14 Basic Properties of Electric Charge,"2024-252024-25RATIONALISATION  OF CONTENT  IN THE TEXTBOOKSIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load onstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing thecontent load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creativemindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalisethe textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERTacross classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:•Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the sameclass•Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject•Difficulty level•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventionsfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning•Content, which is irrelevant in the present contextThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changesgiven above.2024-252024-25"

16 Forces between Multiple Charges,"PREFACEIt gives me pleasure to place this book in the hands of the students, teachers and the public atlarge (whose role cannot be overlooked). It is a natural sequel to the Class XI textbook whichwas brought out in 2006. This book is also a trimmed version of the textbooks which existed sofar. The chapter on ther mal and chemical ef fects of curr ent has been cut out. This topic has alsobeen dropped from the CBSE syllabus. Similarly, the chapter on communications has beensubstantially curtailed. It has been rewritten in an easily comprehensible form.Although most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts andsections in them have been rewritten. The Development Team has been guided by the feedbackreceived from innumerable teachers across the country.In producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic change ofemphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming that they would pursuethis subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view has been prompted by the variousobservations and suggestions made in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005.Similarly, in today’s educational scenario where students can opt for various combinations ofsubjects, we cannot assume that a physics student is also studying mathematics. Therefore,physics has to be presented, so to say, in a standalone form.As in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in many chapters.They are not meant for teaching or examinations. Their purpose is to catch the attention of thereader , to show some applications in daily life or in other ar eas of science and technology, tosuggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts in different areas of physics, andin general, to break the monotony and enliven the book.Featur es like Summary, Points to Ponder , Exer cises and Additional Exer cises at the end ofeach chapter , and Examples have been r etained. Several concept-based Exer cises have beentransferred from end-of-chapter Exercises to Examples with Solutions in the text. It is hopedthat this will make the concepts discussed in the chapter more comprehensible. Several newexamples and exercises have been added. Students wishing to pursue physics further wouldfind Points to Ponder and Additional Exercises very useful and thoughtful. To provide resourcesbeyond the textbook  and to encourage eLear ning, each chapter has been pr ovided withsome relevant website addresses under the title ePhysics . These sites provide additionalmaterial on specific topics and also provide learners with opportunites for interactivedemonstrations/experiments.The intricate concepts of physics must be understood, comprehended and appreciated.Students must learn to ask questions like ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how do we know it’. They will findalmost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain of physics and sciencein general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On the other hand, the question‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in the case of most natural phenomena.In fact, with the understanding of how things happen, it has been possible to make use of manyphenomena to create technological applications for the use of humans.For example, consider statements in a book, like ‘A negatively charged electron is attractedby the positively charged plate’, or ‘In this experiment, light (or electron) behaves like a wave’.You will r ealise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’. This question belongs to the domain ofphilosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can find the force acting, we can find2024-252024-25the wavelength of the photon (or electron), we can determine how things behave under differentconditions, and we can develop instruments which will use these phenomena to our advantage.It has been a pleasure to work for these books at the higher secondary level, along with ateam of members. The Textbook Development Team, Review Team and Editing Teams involvedcollege and university teachers, teachers from Indian Institutes of Technology, scientists fromnational institutes and laboratories, as well as, higher secondary teachers. The feedback andcritical look provided by higher secondary teachers in the various teams are highly laudable.Most box items were generated by members of one or the other team, but three of them weregenerated by friends and well-wishers not part of any team. W e are thankful to Dr P .N. Sen ofPune, Professor Roopmanjari Ghosh of Delhi and Dr Rajesh B Khaparde of Mumbai for allowingus to use their box items, r espectively, in Chapters 3, 4 (Part I) and 9 (Part II). W e are thankfulto the members of the review and editing workshops to discuss and refine the first draft of thetextbook.  W e also expr ess our gratitude to Pr of. Krishna Kumar , Director, NCER T, for entrustingus with the task of presenting this textbook as a part of the national effort for improving scienceeducation. I also thank Pr of. G. Ravindra, Joint Dir ector, NCER T,  for his help fr om time-to-time. Pr of. Hukum Singh, Head , Department of Education in Science and Mathematics, NCER T,was always willing to help us in our endeavour in every possible way.We welcome suggestions and comments fr om our valued users, especially students andteachers.

W e also experience a sensation of an electricshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of abus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences isdischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulateddue to rubbing of insulating sur faces. Y ou might have also hear d thatthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic weare going to discuss in this and the next chapter . Static means anythingthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals withthe study of forces, fields and potentials arising fromstatic charges .1.2  E LECTRIC  CHARGEHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed withwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word2024-252024-252Physicselektr on meaning amber . Many such pairs of materials wer e known whichon rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits ofpapers.It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk clothare brought close to each other , they r epel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. Thetwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods wererubbed, also r epel each other . However , the glass r od and wool attractedeach other . Similarly, two plastic r ods rubbed with cat’s fur r epelled eachother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur . On the other hand, the plasticrod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool withwhich the glass r od is rubbed. The glass r od repels the fur .These seemingly simple facts  were established from years of effortsand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after manycareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds ofan entry which is called the electric char ge. We say that the bodies likeglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquirean electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification andwe find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  eachother . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is calledthe polarity  of charge.When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind ofcharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true forany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrifiedglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, theyno longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other lightobjects as they did on being electrified.Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the chargedbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from theseobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objectsneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were namedas positive  and negative  by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive andthat on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses anelectric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no chargeit is said to be electrically neutral.FIGURE  1.1 Rods: like char ges repel and unlike char ges attract each other .2024-252024-25"
18 Electric Field Lines,"Electric Chargesand Fields3A simple apparatus to detect charge  on a body  is the gold-leafelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in abox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a chargedobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on tothe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator ofthe amount of charge.Try to understand why material bodies acquir e char ge. You know thatall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally thematerials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their chargesare exactly balanced. For ces that hold the molecules together , forces thathold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associatedwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from theforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive andit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It istherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind ofcharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to thisexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, beingless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferredfrom one body to the other .  A body can thus be char ged positively bylosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negativelyby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of theelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod getspositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge iscreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that aretransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in thematerial body.1.3  C ONDUCTORS  AND INSULA TORSSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, othersdo not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily arecalled conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that arecomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animalbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage ofelectricity through them. They are called insulators . Most  substancesfall into one of the two classes stated above *.When some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily getsdistributed over the entir e sur face of the conductor . In contrast, if somecharge is put on an insulator , it stays at the same place. Y ou will lear nwhy this happens in the next chapter .This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic combgets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article*There is a third category called semiconductors , which offer resistance to themovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors andinsulators.2024-252024-254Physicslike spoon does not. The charges on metal leak throughour body to the ground as both are conductors ofelectricity. However , if a metal r od with a wooden or plastichandle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it showssigns of charging.1.4  B ASIC PROPERTIES  OF ELECTRICCHARGEWe have seen that ther e are two types of char ges, namelypositive and negative and their effects tend to cancel eachother . Here,  we shall now describe some other pr opertiesof the electric charge.If the sizes of charged bodies are very small ascompared to the distances between them, we treat themas point charges . All the charge content of the body isassumed to be concentrated at one point in space .1.4.1  Additivity of chargesWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of acharge; we shall follow it  up in the next section. W e shalltentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. Ifa system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the totalcharge of the system is obtained simply by addingalgebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or theyare scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,q2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn.  Char ge has  magnitude but no dir ection, similar to mass. However ,there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body isalways positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. Forexample, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 i nthe same unit.1.4.2  Charge is conservedWe have alr eady  hinted to the fact that when bodies ar e char ged byrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no newcharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electriccharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. Whenwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due tointeractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it isfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved .Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolatedsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyedFIGURE  1.2 Electroscopes: (a)The gold leaf electroscope, (b)Schematics of a simpleelectroscope.2024-252024-25"
19 Electric Flux,"Electric Chargesand Fields5in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turnsinto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus create d haveequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and afterthe creation.1.4.3  Quantisation of chargeExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiplesof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is alwaysgiven byq = newher e n is any integer , positive or negative. This basic unit of char ge isthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the chargeon an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron iswritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e  is termedas quanti sation of charge . There are a large number of situations in physicswhere certain physical quantities are quanti sed. The quanti sation of chargewas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered byEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated byMillikan in 1912.In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called acoulomb  and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in termsthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in asubsequent chapter . In ter ms of this definition, one coulomb is the char geflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of thebasic unit of charge ise = 1.602192 × 10–19 CThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. Inelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encounteredand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in theuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amountof charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2are integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on anybody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased ordecreased also in steps of e.The step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopiclevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge ofa body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of pointsand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous tous but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to2024-252024-256Physics EXAMPLE  1.2  EXAMPLE  1.1each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, manysmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormouscompared to the magnitude of charge e . Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a chargeof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electroniccharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only inunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuousvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has nopractical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopiclevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundredsof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps andquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scaleinvolved that is very important.Example 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another bodyevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 Con the other body?Solution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Thereforethe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimatedto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we willneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very largeunit for many practical purposes.It is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number ofelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024electrons.Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in acup of water?Solution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number ofmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygenatom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive andtotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAWCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between twopoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smallerthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and thecharged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured theforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely asthe square of the distance between the charges and was directlyproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and2024-252024-25"
110 Electric Dipole,"Electric Chargesand Fields7acted along the line joining the two charges . Thus, if twopoint charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,the magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by2 12q qF kr= (1.1)How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?Coulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the forcebetween two charged metallic spheres. When the separationbetween two spheres is much larger than the radius of eachsphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.However , the char ges on the spher es wer e unknown, to beginwith. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose thecharge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contactwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread overthe two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere willbe q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges andmeasured the force for different separations. He then varied thecharges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .Comparing forces for different pairs of  charges at differentdistances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  wasinitially experimentally arrived at  in the manner describedabove. While the original experiments established it at amacroscopic scale, it has also been established down tosubatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicitmagnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:Coulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definitionfor a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so fararbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choiceof k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, thevalue of k is about 9 × 109 22NmC. The unit of charge thatresults from this choice is called a coulomb which we definedearlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), wesee that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 mF = 9 × 109 NThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distanceof 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuumexperiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used laterby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:two charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin deCoulomb (1736 – 1806)Coulomb, a Frenchphysicist, began hiscareer as a militaryengineer in the W estIndies. In 1776, hereturned to Paris andretired to a small estateto do his scientificresearch. He invented atorsion balance tomeasure the quantity ofa force and used it fordetermination of forcesof electric attraction orrepulsion between smallcharged spheres. Hethus arrived in 1785 atthe inverse square lawrelation, now known asCoulomb’s law. The lawhad been anticipated byPriestley and also byCavendish earlier ,though Cavendishnever published hisresults. Coulomb alsofound the inversesquare law of forcebetween unlike and likemagnetic poles.CHARLES AUGUSTIN DE COULOMB  (1736 –1806)2024-252024-258Physics9 × 109 N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit tobe used. In practice, in electrostatics, one usessmaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC.The constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put ask = 1/4 pe0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’slaw is written as01 2214q qFrε=π(1.2)e0 is called the permittivity of fr ee space . The valueof e0 in SI units is0= 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2Since for ce is a vector , it is better to writeCoulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the positionvectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively[see Fig.1.3(a)]. W e denote for ce on q1 due to q2 byF12 and force on q2 due to q1 by F21. The two pointcharges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 forconvenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 isdenoted by r21:r21 = r2 – r1In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12:r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r21 and r12,respectively ( r12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unitvector along the vector . To denote the dir ection fr om 1 to 2 (or fr om 2 to1), we define the unit vectors:ɵ 212121=rrr, ɵɵ ɵ 1212 21 1212,= −rr r rrCoulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located atr1 and r2, respectively is then expressed asɵ 1 22121 22114ε=πF roq qr(1.3)Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:·Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive ornegative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or bothnegative), F21 is along  ˆr21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be forlike charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along –ɵr21(=ɵr12),which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we donot have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlikecharges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1. 3(b)].FIGURE  1.3 (a) Geometry and(b) Forces between charges.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields9 EXAMPLE  1.3Interactive animation on Coulomb’s law:http://webphysics.davidson.edu/physlet_resources/bu_semester2/menu_semester2.html·The force F12  on charge q1 due to charge q2, is obtained from Eq. (1.3),by simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,1 212 12 21 20 121ˆ4ε= = −πF r Fq qrThus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.·Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 andq2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the interveningspace has matter , the situation gets complicated due to the pr esenceof char ged constituents of matter . We shall consider electr ostatics inmatter in the next chapter .Example 1.3  Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two pointcharges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two stationarypoint masses, both have inverse-square dependence on the distancebetween the charges and masses respectively. (a) Compare the strengthof these forces by determining the ratio of their magnitudes (i) for anelectron and a proton and (ii) for two protons. (b) Estimate theaccelerations of electron and proton due to the electrical force of theirmutual attraction when they are 1 Å (= 10-10 m) apart?

For two protons,  the gravitational force is attractivein nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual valuesof these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distancebetween two protons is ~ 10-15 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N,whereas, FG ~ 1.9 × 10–34 N.The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electricalforces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.2024-252024-2510Physics (b) The electric force F exerted by a proton on an electron is same inmagnitude to the for ce exerted by an electr on on a pr oton; however ,the masses of an electron and a proton are different.

How to calculate the force on a charge wherethere are not one but several charges around? Consider asystem of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum.What is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb’s law isnot enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces ofmechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law ofaddition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge  dueto a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forceson that charge due to the  other charges, taken one at a time.The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence ofother charges . This is termed as the principle of superposition .To better understand the concept, consider a system ofthree charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a) . The forceon one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 cantherefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of theforces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1due to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq. (1.3)  eventhough other charges are present.Thus, F12 =1401 2122 12πεq qrˆrFIGURE  1.5 A system of(a) three charges(b) multiple charges.2024-252024-25"

Thetotal force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given bythe vector sum of the forces F12, F13, ...,  F1n:i.e.,F F F F r r1 12 13 1n  =   +  + ...+  = +1401 2122 121 3132 13πεq qrq qrˆ ˆ + + + ... ˆq qrnnn112 1r==∑q qrii ini10 12214πεˆr(1.5)The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law ofaddition of vectors.

By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the chargeq at A is given byF1 = F 1ˆr where 1ˆr is a unit vector along BC.The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has thesame magnitude Fq=2024πεlThe total force F2 on charge q at B is thus F2 = F ˆr2, where ˆr2 is aunit vector along AC. EXAMPLE  1.62024-252024-2514Physics EXAMPLE  1.6Similarly the total force on charge – q at C is F3  = 3 F ˆn, where ˆnisthe unit vector along the direction bisecting the ÐBCA.It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three chargesis zero, i.e.,F1 + F2 + F3 = 0The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the factthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proofis left to you as an exercise.1.7  E LECTRIC  FIELDLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If weplace another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Qwill exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: Ifcharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is therenothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce actwhen we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, theearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we saythat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.When another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts onit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at apoint r is given asE r r r ()= =14140202π πε εQrQrˆ ˆ(1.6)where ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the positionvector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (whichcould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the chargehas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain theforce F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, asF r =1402πεQqrˆ(1.7)Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on thecharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can belooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field ofQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, itexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electricfield E at the location of q. Thus,F(r) = q E(r) (1.8)Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.Some important remarks may be made here:(i)From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due toa charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, theelectric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be definedas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed*An alter nate unit V/m will be intr oduced in the next chapter .FIGURE  1.8 Electricfield (a) due to acharge Q, (b) due to acharge –Q.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields15at that point . The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, iscalled a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of asource charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Qmust r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is broughtat any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electricalforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is tomake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but theratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:EF=→limq q0(1.9)A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbedin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to acharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held totheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituentsinside the sheet.(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally interms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is becauseF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. Theforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particularlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space aroundthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent onthe space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all overthe space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists atevery point in three-dimensional space.(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radiallyoutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge isnegative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Qdepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on thedistance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitudeof its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E due toa point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at itscentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of chargesConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,r2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point inspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to thesystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unittest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the originalpositions of char ges q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and thesuperposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted byposition vector r.2024-252024-2516PhysicsElectric field E1 at r due to q1 at r1 is given byE1 = 140112πεqrP1Pˆrwher e 1Pˆr is a unit vector in the dir ection fr om q1 to P,and r1P is the distance between q1 and P .In the same manner , electric field E2 at r due to q2 atr2 isE2 = 140222πεqrP2Pˆrwhere 2Pˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q2 to Pand r2P is the distance between q2 and P . Similarexpressions hold good for fields E3, E4, ..., En due tocharges q3, q4, ..., qn.By the superposition principle, the electric field E at rdue to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.9)E(r)  =  E1 (r) +  E2 (r)  + …  +  En(r)        =141414011210222202π π π ε ε εqrqrqrnnnPPPPPPˆ ˆ... ˆ r r r + + +E(r) ==∑  140 Pi Pπεqrii in21ˆr (1.10)E is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in spaceand is determined from the positions of the source charges.1.7.2  Physical significance of electric fieldYou may wonder why the notion of electric field has been intr oducedhere at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantityis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’slaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce thisintermediate quantity called the electric field?For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but notreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising theelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point inthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positivetest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbingthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges andis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determinethe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that isdefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electricfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the forcebetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatestspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to anotheris c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a pointdue to a system of charges is thevector sum of the electric fields atthe point due to individual charges.2024-252024-25"
114 Applications of Gauss’s Law,"Electric Chargesand Fields17arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that thenotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and veryuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speedc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accountsfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can bedetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded asphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have anindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to lawsof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of timeand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fieldstransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faradayand is now among the central concepts in physics.Example 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in auniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. Thedirection of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchangedand a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Computethe time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘freefall under gravity’.FIGURE  1.10Solution In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively chargedelectron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E isthe magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron isae  =  eE/mewhere me is the mass of the electron.Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through adistance h is given by  2 2eeeh m hta e E= =For e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,  te = 2.9 × 10–9sIn Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively chargedproton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. Theacceleration of the proton isap  =  eE/mpwhere mp is the mass of the proton; mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg.

This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘freefall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass ofthe body. Note that in this example we have ignored the accelerationdue to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electricfield:ppe Eam=     19 4 127(1 6 10 C) (2 0 10 N C )1 67 10 kg. ..− −−× × ×=×     12 –21 9 10 m s.= ×which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), theacceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is evengreater . Thus, the ef fect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignor edin this example.Example 1.8  Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10–8 C and–10–8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart.

It is a vector quantityand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent Edue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at theorigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of theelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strengthof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electricfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of thedistance of that point from the charge, the vector getsshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointingradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  Inthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., theforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail ofthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one directionand the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thusget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the pointcharge. Have we lost the information about the strengthor magnitude of the field now, because it was containedin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of thefield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strongnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more nearthe char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,resulting in well-separated lines.Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is notimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.82024-252024-2520PhysicsIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which isimportant.We draw the figur e on the plane of paper , i.e., in two-dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishesto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider thenumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicularto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square ofthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing thecharge increases as the square of the distance, the numberof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.We started by saying that the field lines carry infor mationabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicatesthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The fieldlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apartwher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W ecan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R andS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picturecutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field atthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or ratherthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate thearea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a smalltransverse line element Dl  be placed at a distance r  from a point O. Thenthe angle subtended by Dl  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a smallperpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written asDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radialfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distancesr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angleDW is 21rDW at P1 and an element of area 22rDW at P2, respectively. Thenumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. Thenumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(21rDW) atP1 and n/(22rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, thestrength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop anintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields aroundcharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m issomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The moreappr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we haveadopted in this book.Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electricfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence ofelectric field strength on thedistance and its relation to thenumber of field lines.*Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given conewith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equalto DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields21a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at eachpoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. Anarrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify thedirection of electric field from the two possible directionsindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a spacecurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simplecharge configurations. As mentioned earlier , the field linesare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows themonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive chargeare radially outward while those of a single negativecharge are radially inward. The field lines around a systemof two positive charges ( q, q) give a vivid pictorialdescription of their mutual repulsion, while those aroundthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attractionbetween the charges. The field lines follow some importantgeneral properties:(i)Field lines start from positive charges and end atnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they maystart or end at infinity.(ii)In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be takento be continuous curves without any breaks.(iii)Two field lines can never cr oss each other . (If they did,the field at the point of intersection will not have aunique direction, which is absurd.)(iv)Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.This follows from the conservative nature of electricfield (Chapter 2).1.9  E LECTRIC  FLUXConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a smallflat surface d S, in a direction normal to the surface. Therate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing thearea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquidflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface isnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v , butmakes an angle q with it, the projected area in a planeperpendicular to v is δdS cos q. Therefore, the flux goingout of the surface d S is v.ˆndS. For the case of  the electricfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electricflux. We should, however , note that ther e is no flow of aphysically observable quantity unlike the case ofliquid flow.In the picture of electric field lines described above,we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of thestrength of electric field at that point. This means that ifFIGURE  1.14 Field lines due tosome simple charge configurations.2024-252024-2522Physicswe place a small planar element of area DSnormal to E at a point, the number of field linescrossing it is proportional * to E DS. Nowsuppose we tilt the area element by angle q.Clearly, the number of field lines crossing thearea element will be smaller . The pr ojection ofthe area element normal to E is DS cos q. Thus,the number of field lines crossing DS isproportional to E DS cos q. When q = 90°, fieldlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross itat all (Fig. 1.15).The orientation of area element and notmerely its magnitude is important in manycontexts. For example, in a stream, the amountof water flowing through a ring will naturallydepend on how you hold the ring. If you holdit normal to the flow, maximum water will flowthrough it than if you hold it with some otherorientation. This shows that an area elementshould be tr eated as a vector . It has amagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planararea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of theplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.How to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imaginedividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associatedwith it, as explained before.Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is alongits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction dowe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the givencontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is takento be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention usedin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closedsurface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element andˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df throughan area element DS is defined byDf = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cuttingthe area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For aclosed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle betweenE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look atthe expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on theinclination q between E and ˆn.FIGURE  1.16Convention fordefining normalˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. Thenumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose todraw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossinga given area at different points.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields23projection of area normal to E,  or E^ DS, i.e., component of E along thenormal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. Theunit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, inprinciple, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All wehave to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate theflux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux f through asurface S isf ~ S E.DS (1.12)The approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken tobe constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exactonly when you take the limit DS ® 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is writtenas an integral.1.10  E LECTRIC  DIPOLEAn electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and – q,separated by a distance 2 a. The line connecting the two charges definesa direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said tobe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q iscalled the centre of the dipole.The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does notmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, whenadded, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger thanthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fieldsdue to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipoletherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependenceon r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas areborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:1.10.1  The field of an electric dipoleThe electric field of the pair of charges (– q and q) at any point in spacecan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is onthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane  of the dipole,i.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  Theelectric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electricfields E–q due to the charge – q and E+q due to the charge q, by theparallelogram law of vectors.(i) For points on the axisLet the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side ofthe charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.17(a). ThenE p−= −+qqr a402πε( )□[1.13(a)]where ˆp is the unit vector along the dipole axis (from – q to q).

Clearly, the components normal to the dipoleaxis cancel away. The components along the dipole axisadd up. The total electric field is opposite to ˆp. We haveE = – (E +q + E –q) cos q  ˆp= −+242 2 3 2q ar aoπε( )□/p (1.17)At large distances ( r >> a), this reduces toE p = − >>243q arr aoπεˆ ( ) (1.18)From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at largedistances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the productqa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole momentvector  p of an electric dipole is defined byp  = q × 2a ˆp (1.19)that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the linefrom – q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distancestakes simple forms:At a point on the dipole axisEp=243πεor(r >> a) (1.20)At a point on the equatorial planeEp= −43πεor(r >> a) (1.21)FIGURE  1.17 Electric field of a dipoleat (a) a point on the axis, (b) a pointon the equatorial plane of the dipole.p is the dipole moment vector ofmagnitude p = q × 2a  anddirected from – q to q.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields25 EXAMPLE  1.9 Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distancesfalls of f not as 1/ r2 but as1/ r3. Further ,  the magnitude and the dir ectionof the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on theangle  between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2 a appr oaches zer o,the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the productp = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole . For apoint dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) ar e exact, true for any r.1.10.2  Physical significance of dipolesIn most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges *lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 andCH4 are of this type of molecules. However , they develop a dipole momentwhen an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres ofnegative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore theyhave a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electricfield. Such molecules are called polar molecules. W ater molecules, H2O,is an example of this type. V arious materials give rise to inter estingproperties and important applications in the presence or  absence ofelectric field.Example 1.9 Two charges ±10 mC are placed 5.0 mm apart.

Thus, we canexpect to get approximately the same result as above by directly usingthe for mula for electric field at a far -away point on the axis of a dipole.For a dipole consisting of charges ± q, 2a distance apart, the electricfield at a distance r from the centre on the axis of the dipole has amagnitudeEpr=2403πε(r/a >> 1)where p = 2a q is the magnitude of the dipole moment.The direction of electric field on the dipole axis is always along thedirection of the dipole moment vector (i.e., from – q to q). Here,p =10–5 C × 5 × 10–3 m  = 5 × 10–8 C mTherefore,E  =812 2 1 22 5 10 Cm4 (8.854 10 C N m )−− − −× ×π ×3 6 31(15) 10 m−×× = 2.6 × 105  N C–1along the dipole moment direction AB, which is close to the resultobtained earlier .(b) Field at Q due to charge + 10 mC at B=512 2 1 210 C4 (8.854 10 C N m )−− − −π ×2 2 4 21[15 (0.25) ] 10 m−+ ××=  3.99 × 106  N C–1 along BQField at Q due to charge –10 mC at A=512 2 1 210 C4 (8.854 10 C N m )−− − −π ×2 2 4 21[15 (0.25) ] 10 m−+ ××=  3.99 × 106  N C–1 along QA.Clearly, the components of these two forces with equal magnitudescancel along the direction OQ but add up along the direction parallelto BA.

Again, the r esult agr ees with that obtainedbefore.1.11  D IPOLE IN A UNIFORM  EXTERNAL  FIELDConsider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniformexternal field E, as shown in Fig. 1.19. (By permanent dipole, wemean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)There is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force onthe dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar eseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torqueon the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) isindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude ofeach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendiculardistance between the two antiparallel forces).Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq       = 2 q a E  sinqIts dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its directionis nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,t tt tt  = p × E (1.22)This torque will tend to align the dipole with the fieldE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition therewill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. Thegeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simplersituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. Ineither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net forceon the dipole if E is not uniform.Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen thatwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in thedirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasingfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of pwith respect to E.This brings us to a common observation in frictionalelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces ofpaper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr oughfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explainsthe attractive force? Taking the clue from the precedingFIGURE  1.19 Dipole in auniform electric field.FIGURE  1.20 Electric force on adipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  Eantiparallel to p.2024-252024-2528Physicsdiscussion, the char ged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper , i.e., inducesa net dipole moment in the dir ection of field. Further , the electric fielddue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes adipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seenthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb!1.12  C ONTINUOUS  CHARGE  DISTRIBUTIONWe have so far dealt with char ge configurations involving discr ete char gesq1, q2, ..., qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that themathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. Formany purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr etecharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. Forexample, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specifythe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic chargedconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopicscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) andspecify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char gedensity  s at the area element byQSσΔ=Δ(1.23)We can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive ata continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surfacecharge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and thediscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  representsmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed outaverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. Theunits for s are C/m2.Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volumecharge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined byQlλΔ=Δ(1.24)where Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,however , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,and DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l areC/m. The volume charge density  (sometimes simply called charge density)is defined in a similar manner:QVρΔ=Δ(1.25)where DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volumeelement DV that includes a large number of microscopic chargedconstituents. The units for r are C/m3.The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that weadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21Definition of linear ,surface and volumecharge densities.In each case, theelement ( Dl, DS, DV)chosen is small onthe macroscopicscale but containsa very large numberof microscopicconstituents.*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they arediscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.2024-252024-25"
21 Introduction,"Electric Chargesand Fields29the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. Weregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecularconstitution.The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained inmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Supposea continuous char ge distribution in space has a char ge density r. Chooseany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in thecharge distribution be r. The char ge density r may vary fr om point topoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the char ge distribution into smallvolume elements of size DV. The char ge in a volume element DV is rDV.Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)with position vector R (Fig. 1.21). Electric field due to the charge rDV isgiven by Coulomb’s law:201ˆ4V'r'ρεΔΔ =πE r (1.26)wher e r¢ is the distance between the char ge element and P , and  ˆr¢ is aunit vector in the dir ection fr om the char ge element to P . By thesuperposition principle, the total electric field due to the chargedistribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to differentvolume elements:201ˆ4all VV'r'ρεΔΔ≅ ΣπE r (1.27)Note that r, r¢,  ˆ′r all can vary fr om point to point. In a strictmathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomesan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field canbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or partdiscrete and part continuous.1.13  G AUSS’S LAWAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider thetotal flux thr ough a spher e of radius r, which encloses a point char ge qat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown inFig. 1.22.The flux through an area element DS is20ˆ4qrφεΔ = Δ = ΔπE S r Sii (1.28)where we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a singlecharge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre tothe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point isalong the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and ˆr  havethe same direction. Therefore,204qSrφεΔ = Δπ(1.29)since the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.The total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up fluxthrough all the different area elements:FIGURE  1.22  Fluxthrough a sphereenclosing a pointcharge q at its centre.2024-252024-2530Physics204all SqSrφεΔ= Σ ΔπSince each area element of the sphere is at the samedistance r from the charge,2 20 4 4all Soq qS Sr rφε εΔ= Σ Δ =π πNow S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4 pr2. Thus,220 044q qrrφε ε= × π =π(1.30)Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result ofelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.We state Gauss’s law  without pr oof:Electric flux through a closed surface S= q/ e0(1.31)q = total charge enclosed by S.The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface iszero if no char ge is enclosed by the sur face. W e can see that explicitly inthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closedcylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The totalflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 representthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of thecylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of theclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point isperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar dnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.Therefore,f1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2S1 = S2 = Swhere  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electricflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total chargecontained in the closed surface is zero.The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true ingeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Letus note some important points regarding this law:(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shapeor size.(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes thesum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be locatedanywhere inside the surface.(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are somecharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appearson the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside andoutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,represents only the total charge inside S.FIGURE  1.23  Calculation of theflux of uniform electric fieldthrough the sur face of a cylinder .2024-252024-25"
22 Electrostatic Potential,"Electric Chargesand Fields31 EXAMPLE  1.10(iv)The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is calledthe Gaussian sur face. Y ou may choose any Gaussian sur face andapply Gauss’s law. However , take car e not to let the Gaussian sur facepass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field dueto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location ofany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows withoutany bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough acontinuous charge distribution.(v)Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of theelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This isfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence ondistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’slaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.Example 1.10  The electric field components in Fig. 1.24 areEx = ax1/2, Ey = Ez = 0, in which a = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) theflux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube. Assumethat a = 0.1 m.FIGURE  1.24Solution(a)Since the electric field has only an x component, for facesperpendicular to x direction, the angle between E and DS is± p/2. Therefore, the flux  f = E.DS is separately zero for each faceof the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude ofthe electric field at the left face isEL = ax1/2 = aa1/2(x = a at the left face).The magnitude of electric field at the right face isER = a x1/2 = a (2a)1/2(x = 2a at the right face).The corresponding fluxes arefL= EL.DS = ˆL LSΔE n⋅=EL DS cos q = –EL DS, since q = 180°   = – ELa2fR= ER.DS = ER DS cos q  = ER DS,   since q = 0°   = ERa2Net flux through the cube2024-252024-25"

24 Potential due to an Electric Dipole,"Electric Chargesand Fields331.14  A PPLICA TIONS OF GAUSS’S LAWThe electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, thesummation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carriedout to give electric field at every point inspace. For some symmetric chargeconfigurations, however , it is possible toobtain the electric field in a simple way usingthe Gauss’s law. This is best understood bysome examples.1.14.1 Field due to an infinitelylong straight uniformlycharged wireConsider an infinitely long thin straight wirewith uniform linear charge density l. The wireis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose wetake the radial vector from O to P and rotate itaround the wir e. The points P , P¢, P¢¢ soobtained are completely equivalent withrespect to the charged wire. This implies thatthe electric field must have the same magnitudeat these points. The direction of electric field atevery point must be radial (outward if l > 0,inward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2of the wire, as shown. The electric fieldsproduced by the two elements of the pair whensummed give a resultant electric field whichis radial (the components normal to the radialvector cancel). This is true for any such pairand hence the total field at any point P isradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,electric field does not depend on the positionof P along the length of the wire. In short, theelectric field is everywhere radial in the planecutting the wire normally, and its magnitudedepends only on the radial distance r.To calculate the field, imagine a cylindricalGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).Since the field is everywhere radial, fluxthrough the two ends of the cylindricalGaussian surface is zero. At the cylindricalpart of the surface, E is normal to the surfaceat every point, and its magnitude is constant,since it depends only on r. The surface ar eaof the curved part is  2 prl, where l is the lengthof the cylinder .FIGURE 1.26 (a) Electric field due to aninfinitely long thin straight wire is radial,(b) The Gaussian surface for a long thinwire of uniform linear charge density.2024-252024-2534PhysicsFlux through the Gaussian surface=flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface=E × 2prlThe surface includes charge equal to l l. Gauss’s law then givesE × 2prl = ll/e0i.e.,E  = 02rλεπVectorially, E at any point is given by0ˆ2rλε=πE n (1.32)where ˆn is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passingthrough the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l isnegative.Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unitvector , i.e., as A = A ˆa, the scalar A is  an algebraic number . It can benegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unitvector ˆaif A > 0 and opposite to ˆa if A < 0. When we want to restrict tonon-negative values, we use the symbol Aand call it the modulus of A.Thus, 0≥A .Also note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface ( ll)was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entirewire. Further , the assumption that the wir e is infinitely long is crucial.Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curvedpart of the cylindrical Gaussian sur face. However , Eq. (1.32) isapproximately true for electric field around the central portions of a longwire, where the end effects may be ignored.1.14.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheetLet s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet(Fig. 1.27). W e take the x-axis nor mal to the given plane. By symmetry,the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its directionat every point must be parallel to the x-direction.We can take the Gaussian sur face to be arectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional areaA, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) Asseen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 willcontribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallelto the other faces and they, therefore, do notcontribute to the total flux.The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in – xdirection while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2is in the + x direction. Therefore, flux  E.DS throughboth the surfaces are equal and add up. Thereforethe net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.The charge enclosed by the closed surface is sA.Therefore by Gauss’s law,FIGURE  1.27  Gaussian surface for auniformly charged infinite plane sheet.2024-252024-25"

Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law hasbrought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in themiddle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.1.14.3   Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shellLet s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell ofradius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. Thefield at any point P , outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radialdistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,along the radius vector).(i)Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside theshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take theGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centreO, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalentrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what wemean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each pointof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitudeE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E andDS at every point are parallel and the flux through eachelement is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through theGaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed iss × 4 p R2. By Gauss’s lawE × 4 p r2 = 204RσεπOr,  22 20 04R qEr rσε ε= =πwhere q  =  4 p R2 s is the total charge on the spherical shell.Vectorially,20ˆ4qrε=πE r (1.34)The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward ifq < 0. This, however , is exactly the field pr oduced by a char geq placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field dueto a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell isconcentrated at its centre.(ii)Field inside the shell:  In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside theshell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.FIGURE  1.28  Gaussiansurfaces for a point with(a) r > R, (b) r < R.2024-252024-2536Physics EXAMPLE  1.12The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, isE × 4 p r2. However , in this case, the Gaussian sur face encloses nocharge. Gauss’s law then givesE × 4 p r2 =  0i.e., E = 0          ( r < R ) (1.35)that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all pointsinside the shell *. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’slaw which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification ofthis result confirms the 1/ r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.Example 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have apositively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by auniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as awhole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distancer from the nucleus?FIGURE  1.29Solution   The charge distribution for this model of the atom is asshown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform sphericalcharge distribution of radius R must be – Z e, since the atom (nucleusof charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives usthe negative char ge density r, since we must have340–3RZeρπ=or 334ZeRρ=−πTo find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r awayfrom the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the sphericalsymmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electricfield E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what thedirection of r. Its dir ection is along (or opposite to) the radius vector rfrom the origin to the point P . The obvious Gaussian sur face is aspherical sur face centr ed at the nucleus. W e consider two situations,namely, r < R and r > R.(i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is    f  =  E (r) × 4 p r2*Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 7.5 of Class XITextbook of Physics.2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields37 EXAMPLE  1.12wher e E (r)  is the magnitude of the electric field at r.

Thus, from Gauss’slaw,E (r) × 4 p  r2 = 0  or  E (r) = 0;    r > RAt r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.SUMMARY1.Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,molecules and bulk matter .2.From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer thatthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repeland unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rodrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur isthen negative.3.Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; inelectrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.4.Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivityand conservation.Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a bodyis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,q = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges+e, –e, respectively.

26 Equipotential Surfaces,"38Physicsbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric chargefrom one body to another , but no cr eation or destructionof charge.5.Coulomb’s Law : The mutual electrostatic force between two pointcharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inverselyproportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.Mathematically,F21 = force on q2 due to  1 21 21 221ˆk (q q )qr= rwhere 21ˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  014επis the constant of proportionality.In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value ofthe constant e0 ise0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2The approximate value of k isk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–26.The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a protonand an electron is2392 4 10e pk e.G m m≅ ×7.Superposition Principle : The principle is based on the property that theforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are notaffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). Foran assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, isthe vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on  q1 due to q3,and so on. For each pair , the for ce is given by the Coulomb’s law fortwo char ges stated earlier .8.The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is theforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided bythe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q hasa magnitude | q|/4pe0r2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric fieldalso satisfies superposition principle.9.An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangentat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at thatpoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strengthof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regionsof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field isweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformlyspaced parallel straight lines.10.Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines arecontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot crosseach other . (iii) Electr ostatic field lines start at positive char ges andend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.11.An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and – qseparated by some distance 2 a.

Why do they not fly away?You will lear n that ther e is a thir d kind of a fundamental for ce,called the str ong for ce which holds them together . The range ofdistance wher e this for ce is ef fective is, however , very small ~10-14m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons arenot allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms theirstructure as they exist in na ture.2.Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-squarelaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while2024-252024-25Electric Chargesand Fields41Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowingpossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despitebeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasiveforce in nature.3.The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter ofchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SIunits, however , what is defined is the unit of curr ent (A) via its magneticeffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply definedby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it isapproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.4.The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (asmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms ofmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generallymuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unitof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit forelectric effects.5.The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is relatedto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;charge is a scalar .6.Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is alsoinvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not alwaystrue for every scalar . For example, kinetic ener gy is a scalar underrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relativemotion.7.Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a propertyindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in aninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vectorquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).8.Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.9.Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, orequated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by thepresence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,four-body, etc., for ces which arise only when ther e are mor e thantwo charges.10.The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not definedat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volumecharge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuousacross the surfac e.11.The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zerois not zero; but for distances large compared to the size ofthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/ r2, typical of fielddue to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example ofthis fa ct.2024-252024-25"

29 Electrostatics of Conductors,"2.1  I 2.1  I2.1  I 2.1  I2.1  I NTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONIn Chapters 5 and 7 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy wasintroduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from apoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the externalforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losingan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic andpotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are calledconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples ofconservative forces.Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservativeforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependenceon distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – themasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’slaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitationalfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in anelectrostatic field.Consider an electrostatic field  E E E  E E due to some charge configuration.First, for simplicity, consider the field E EE EE due to a charge Q placed at theorigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to apoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With referenceChapter TwoELECTROSTATICPOTENTIAL ANDCAPACITANCE2024-25Physics46to Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positiveor both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.Two remarks may be made here. First, we assumethat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturbthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at theorigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by someunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q fromR to P , we apply an exter nal for ce Fext just enough tocounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).This means there is no net force on or acceleration ofthe char ge q when it is br ought fr om R to P , i.e., it isbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. Inthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the workdone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potentialenergy of the char ge q. If the exter nal for ce is r emoved on r eaching P, theelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potentialenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such away that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P isWRP =           =    –  (2.1)This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets storedas potential energy.At every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses acertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potentialenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between pointsR and P .Thus, potential energy differenceP R RP U U U WΔ = − = (2.2)(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electricforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e. , –WRP.)Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference betweentwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving(without acceleratin g) charge q from one point to another for electric fieldof any arbitrary charge configuration.Two important comments may be made at this stage:(i)The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positionsof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field inmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initialand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go fromone point to the other . This is the fundamental characteristic of aconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not bemeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independenceof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using theCoulomb’s law. W e omit this pr oof her e.FIGURE  2.1 A test charge q (> 0) ismoved from the point R to thepoint P against the repulsiveforce on it by the charge Q (> 0)placed at the origin.2024-25Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance47(ii)Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference  in termsof the physically meaningful quantity work . Clearly,potential energy so defined is undetermined to within anadditive constant.What this means is that the actual valueof potential energy is not physically significant; it is onlythe dif ference of potential ener gy that is significant. W e canalways add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy atevery point, since this will not change the potential energydifference:( ) ( )P R P R U U U Uα α+ − + = −Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the pointwhere potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to haveelectrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,if we take the point R at infinity, we get from Eq. (2.2)P P P W U U U∞ ∞ = − = (2.3)Since the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with adefinition of potential energy of a charge q at any point.Potential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of fielddue to any charge configuration)  is the work done by theexter nal for ce (equal and opposite to the electric for ce) inbringing the charge q from infinity to that point .2.2  E LECTROST ATIC POTENTIALConsider any general static char ge configuration. W e definepotential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work doneon the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q , sincethe force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at thatpoint due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore,convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, sothat the resulting quantity is independent of q . In other words,work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electricfield associated with the charge configuration. This leads tothe idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given chargeconfiguration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:Work done by exter nal for ce in bringing a unit positivecharge from point R to P= VP – VR  =−U UqP R(2.4)where VP and VR  are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively.Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potentialdifference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose thepotential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:Work done by an exter nal for ce in bringing a unit positive char gefrom infinity to a point = electrostatic potential ( V) at that point.COUNT ALESSANDRO VOLTA (1745 –1827) Count Alessandr o Volta(1745 – 1827)  Italianphysicist, professor atPavia. V olta establishedthat the animal electri-city observed by LuigiGalvani, 1737–1798, inexperiments with frogmuscle tissue placed incontact with dissimilarmetals, was not due toany exceptional propertyof animal tissues butwas also generatedwhenever any wet bodywas sandwiched betweendissimilar metals. Thisled him to develop thefirst voltaic  pile, orbattery, consisting of alarge stack of moist disksof cardboard (electro-lyte) sandwichedbetween disks of metal(electrodes).2024-25Physics48In other words, the electrostatic potential ( V)at any point in a region with electrostatic field isthe work done in bringing a unit positivecharge (without acceleration) from infinity tothat point.The qualifying remarks made earlier regardingpotential energy also apply to the definition ofpotential. To obtain the work done per unit testcharge, we should take an infinitesimal test chargedq, obtain the work done dW in bringing it frominfinity to the point and determine the ratiodW/dq. Also, the external force at every point of thepath is to be equal and opposite to the electrostaticforce on the test charge at that point.2.3  P OTENTIAL DUE TO A POINT CHARGEConsider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take Qto be positive. W e wish to deter mine the potential at any point P withposition vector r from the origin. For that we mustcalculate the work done in bringing a unit positivetest char ge from infinity to the point P . For Q > 0,the work done against the repulsive force on thetest charge is positive.

210 Dielectrics and Polarisation,"Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance49 EXAMPLE  2.1Equation (2.8) is true for anysign of the charge Q, though weconsidered Q > 0 in its derivation.For Q < 0, V < 0, i.e., work done (bythe external force) per unit positivetest charge in bringing it frominfinity to the point is negative. Thisis equivalent to saying that workdone by the electrostatic force inbringing the unit positive chargeform infinity to the point P ispositive. [This is as it should be,since for Q < 0, the force on a unitpositive test charge is attractive, sothat the electrostatic force and thedisplacement (from infinity to P) arein the same direction.] Finally, wenote that Eq. (2.8) is consistent withthe choice that potential at infinitybe zero.Figure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential ( 1/r) and theelectr ostatic field ( 1/r2 ) varies with r.Example 2.1(a)Calculate the potential at a point P due to a charge of 4 × 10–7Clocated 9 cm away.(b)Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 × 10–9 Cfrom infinity to the point P .

Any arbitrary infinitesimalpath can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One alongr and another perpendicular to  r. The work done corresponding tothe later will be zero.2.4  P OTENTIAL DUE TO  AN ELECTRIC  DIPOLEAs we lear nt in the last chapter , an electric dipole consists of two char gesq and  – q separated by a (small) distance 2 a. Its total charge is zero. It ischaracterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2aand which points in the dir ection fr om –q to q (Fig. 2.5). W e also saw thatthe electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends notjust on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p. Further ,FIGURE  2.4 Variation of potential V with r [in units of(Q/4pe0) m-1] (blue curve) and field with r [in unitsof (Q/4pe0) m-2] (black curve) for a point charge Q.2024-25Physics50the field falls off, at large distance, not as1/r2 (typical of field due to a single charge)but as 1/ r3. We, now, deter mine the electricpotential due to a dipole and contrast itwith the potential due to a single charge.As before, we take the origin at thecentre of the dipole. Now we know that theelectric field obeys the superpositionprinciple. Since potential is related to thework done by the field, electrostaticpotential also follows the superpositionprinciple.

The potential in theequatorial plane ( q = p/2) is zero.The important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipolefrom that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):(i)The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on theangle between the position vector  r and the dipole moment vector p.(It is, however , axially symmetric about p. That is, if you r otate theposition vector r  about  p, keeping q fixed, the points correspondingto P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P .)(ii)The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/ r2, not as1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single char ge. (You canrefer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/ r2 versus r and 1/ r versus r,drawn there in another context.)2.5  P OTENTIAL DUE TO A SYSTEM  OF CHARGESConsider a system of charges q1, q2,…, qn with position vectors r1, r2,…,rn relative to some origin (Fig. 2.6).

(2.18)If we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a chargedensity r(r), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each ofsize Dv and carrying a char ge rDv. W e then deter mine the potential dueto each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over allsuch contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entiredistribution.We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a unifor mly char ged spherical shell,the electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentratedat the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by014qVrε=π   ( )r R≥ [2.19(a)]where q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius. The electric fieldinside the shell is zero.

For a single charge q, the potential is givenby Eq. (2.8):14oqVrε=πThis shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotentialsurfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centredat the charge.Now the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines startingfrom or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surfacepassing through that point. This is true in general: for any chargeconfiguration , equipotential sur face thr ough a point is nor mal to theelectric field at that point . The proof of this statement is simple.If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it wouldhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test chargeagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have tobe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotentialsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on thesurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.The electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surfaceat every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picturein addition to the picture of electric field lines around a chargeconfiguration.FIGURE  2.9 For asingle charge q(a) equipotentialsurfaces arespherical surfacescentred at thecharge, and(b) electric fieldlines are radial,starting from thecharge if q > 0.For a uniform electric field E, say, along the x-axis, the equipotentialsurfaces are planes normal to the x-axis, i.e., planes parallel to the y-zplane (Fig. 2.10).

214 Combination of Capacitors,"Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance552.6.1  Relation between field and potentialConsider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12)with potential values V and V + d V, where d V is the change in V in thedirection of the electric field E. Let P be a point on thesurface B. d l is the perpendicular distance of thesurface A fr om P. Imagine that a unit positive char geis moved along this perpendicular from the surface Bto surface A against the electric field. The work donein this process is | E|d l.This work equals the potential differenceVA–VB.Thus,|E|d l = V – (V + dV)= – dVi.e., |E|=−δδVl(2.20)Since dV is negative, dV = – |dV|. we can rewriteEq (2.20) asE= − = +δδδδVlVl(2.21)We thus arrive at two important conclusions concer ning the r elationbetween electric field and potential:(i)Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreasessteepest.(ii)Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potentialper unit displacement nor mal to the equipotential sur face at the point.2.7  P OTENTIAL E NERGY OF A SYSTEM  OF CHARGESConsider first the simple case of two charges q1and q2 with position vectorr1 and r2 relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we considerthe charges q1 and q2 initially at infinity and determine the work done byan external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,first the charge q1 is brought from infinity to the point r1. There is noexternal field against which work needs to be done, so work done inbringing q1 from infinity to r1 is zero. This charge produces a potential inspace given byVqr101114=πεPwhere r1P is the distance of a point P in space from the location of q1.From the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 frominfinity to the point r2 is q2 times the potential at r2 due to q1:work done on q2 = 1401 212πεq qrFIGURE  2.12  From thepotential to the field.2024-25Physics56where r12 is the distance between points 1 and 2.Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work getsstored in the form of potential energy of the system. Thus,the potential energy of a system of two charges q1 and q2 isUq qr=1401 212πε(2.22)Obviously, if q2 was brought first to its present location andq1 brought later , the potential ener gy U would be the same.More generally, the potential energy expression,Eq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specifiedlocations, because of path -independence of work for electrostatic force.Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of  q1and q2. If q1q2 > 0, potentialenergy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges ( q1q2 > 0),electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed tobe done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finitedistance apart. For unlike charges ( q1 q2 < 0), the electrostatic force isattractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against thisforce to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity tothe present locations), so the potential energy is negative.Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number ofpoint charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of threecharges q1, q2 and q3 located at r1, r2, r3, respectively. To bring q1 firstfrom infinity to r1, no work is required. Next we bring q2 from infinity tor2.

In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This questionwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostaticpotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question againto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potentialenergy of a char ge (or char ges) in an exter nal field. The exter nal field E isnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish tocalculate.  E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).Theexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown orunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostaticpotential V due to the exter nal sour ces. W e assume that the char ge qdoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. Thisis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by otherunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sourcesmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far awayat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again thatwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q(and later , a system of char ges) in the exter nal field; we ar e not inter estedin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.The external electric field E and the corresponding external potentialV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the workdone in bringing a unit positive char ge from infinity to the point P .2024-25Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance59 EXAMPLE  2.5(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zer o.) Thus, work done inbringing a char ge q from infinity to the point P in the exter nal field is q V.This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q . If the point P hasposition vector r relative to some origin, we can write:Potential energy of q at r in an external field= qV(r) (2.27)where V(r) is the exter nal potential at the point r.Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated bya potential difference of DV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qDV = 1.6  ×10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt  or 1eV, i.e.,1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used inatomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6  × 10–16J, 1 MeV= 106eV = 1.6  × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6  × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV= 1.6 × 10–7J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI PhysicsPart I, Table 6.1.]2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in anexternal fieldNext, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1and q2 located at r1and r2, respectively, in an external field? First, wecalculate the work done in bringing the charge q1 from infinity to r1.Work done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider thework done in bringing q2 to r2. In this step, work is done not only againstthe external field E but also against the field due to q1.Work done on q2 against the exter nal field= q2 V (r2)Work done on q2 against the field due to q11 2124oq qrε=πwher e  r12 is the distance between q1 and q2.

Suppose an external torque t ttttext isapplied in such a manner that it just neutralises thistorque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle q0to angle q1 at an infinitesimal angular speed and withoutangular acceleration.  The amount of work done by theexternal torque will be given by( ) cos cospEθ θ0 1 = − (2.31)This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We canthen associate potential energy U(q) with an inclination q  of the dipole.Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing theangle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choiceis to take q0 = p / 2. (A n explanation for it is provided towards the end ofdiscussion.)   We can then write,(2.32)FIGURE  2.16 Potential energy of adipole in a uniform external field.2024-25Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance61 EXAMPLE  2.6This expression can alternately be understood also from Eq. (2.29).We apply Eq. (2.29) to the present system of two charges + q and – q. Thepotential energy  expression then reads()( ) ( )21 2[ ]4 2qU q V Vaθε0= − −′π ×r r (2.33)Here, r1 and r2 denote the position vectors of + q and – q. Now, thepotential difference between positions r1 and r2 equals the work donein bringing a unit positive charge against field from r2 to r1. Thedisplacement parallel to the force is 2 a cosq. Thus, [ V(r1)–V (r2)] =–E × 2a cosq . We thus obtain,()2 2cos4 2 4 2θ θε ε0 0= − − = − − ′π × π ×p.Eq qU pEa a(2.34)We note that U¢ (q) differs fr om U(q) by a quantity which is just a constantfor a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential  energy, wecan drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32).We can now understand why we took q0=p/2. In this case, the workdone against the exter nal field E in bringing + q and – q are equal andopposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V (r1)  – V (r2)]=0.Example 2.6  A molecule of a substance has a permanent electricdipole moment of magnitude 10–29 C m. A mole of this substance ispolarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic fieldof magnitude 106 V m–1. The direction of the field is suddenly changedby an angle of 60º. Estimate the heat released by the substance inaligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity,assume 100% polarisation of the sample.Solution   Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10–29 C mAs 1 mole of the substance contains 6 × 1023 molecules,total dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 × 1023 × 10–29 C m    = 6 × 10–6 C mInitial potential energy, Ui = –pE cos q = –6×10–6×106 cos 0° = –6 JFinal potential energy (when q = 60°), Uf = –6 × 10–6 × 106 cos 60° = –3 JChange in potential energy = –3 J – (–6J) = 3 JSo, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy releasedby the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.2.9  E LECTROST ATICS OF CONDUCTORSConductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1.Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, thesecharge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electronspart away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are freewithin the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form akind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and moverandomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they driftagainst the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nucleiand the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolyticconductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but2024-25Physics62the situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the chargecarriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by theso-called chemical for ces (see Chapter 3). W e shall r estrict our discussionto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regardingelectrostatics of conductors.1. Inside a conductor , electr ostatic field is zer oConsider a conductor , neutral or char ged. Ther e may also be an exter nalelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current insideor on the sur face of the conductor , the electric field is zer o everywher einside the conductor . This fact can be taken as the defining pr operty of aconductor . A conductor has fr ee electr ons. As long as electric field is notzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In thestatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that theelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside aconductor .2.At the sur face of a char ged conductor , electr ostatic fieldmust be normal to the surface at every pointIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zerocomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductorwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,E should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field  at thesurface of a char ged conductor must be nor mal to the sur face at everypoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zeroeven at the surface.) See result 5.3.The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge inthe static situationA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative chargesin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.This follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume elementv inside a conductor . On the closed sur face S bounding the volumeelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through Sis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. Butthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can bemade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any pointinside the conductor , and any excess char ge must r eside at the sur face.4.Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volumeof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) onits surfaceThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductorand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done inmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. Thatis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or onthe sur face of the conductor . Hence, the r esult. If the conductor is char ged,2024-25Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance63electric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will bedifferent for the surface and a point just outside the surface.In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape andcharge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constantvalue of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor tothe other .5.Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor0ˆσε=E n (2.35)where s is the surface charge density and ˆn is a unit vector normalto the surface in the outward direction.To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussiansurface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pillbox is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. Ithas a small area of cross section d S and negligible height.Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, thefield is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,the contribution to the total flux through the pill boxcomes only from the outside (circular) cross-sectionof the pill box. This equals  ± EdS (positive for s > 0,negative for s < 0), since over the small area  dS, Emay be considered constant and E and dS are parallelor antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill boxis  sdS.By Gauss’s lawEdS = 0Sσ δεE = 0σε(2.36)Including the fact that electric field is normal to thesurface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), whichis true for both signs of s. For s > 0, electric field isnormal to the surface outward; for s < 0, electric fieldis normal to the surface inward.6.Electrostatic shieldingConsider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. Aremarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whateverbe the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on theconductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We haveproved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a chargedspherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use ofthe spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing ofelectric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentionedabove, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductorFIGURE  2.17  The Gaussian surface(a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (2.35)for electric field at the surface of acharged conductor .2024-25Physics64 EXAMPLE  2.7FIGURE  2.18  The electric field inside acavity of any conductor is zero. Allcharges reside only on the outer surfaceof a conductor with cavity. (There are nocharges placed in the cavity.)is charged or charges are induced on a neutralconductor by an external field, all charges resideonly on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 areomitted here, but we note their importantimplication. Whatever be the charge and fieldconfiguration outside, any cavity in a conductorremains shielded from outside electric influence: thefield inside the cavity is always zero . This is knownas electrostatic shielding . The effect can be madeuse of in protecting sensitive instruments fromoutside electrical influence.

Why?(d)A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happensto the bird. A man standing on the ground touches the same lineand gets a fatal shock. Why?Solution(a)This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The moleculesin the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting  in anet force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, frictionbetween hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not getcharged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper .FIGURE  2.19  Some important electr ostatic pr operties of a conductor .2024-25"

In contrast to conductors,they have no (or negligible number o f) charge carriers. Recall from Section2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in anexternal electric field. The free charge carriers moveand charge distribution in the conductor adjustsitself in such a way that the electric field due toinduced charges opposes the external field withinthe conductor. This happens until, in the staticsituation, the two fields cancel each other and thenet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In adielectric, this free movement of charges is notpossible. It turns out that the external field inducesdipole moment by stretching or re-orientingmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of allthe molecular dipole moments is net charges  on thesurface of the dielectric which produce a field thatopposes the external field.  Unlike in a conductor,however, the opposing field so induced does notexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.The extent of the effect depends on thenature of the dielectric. To understand theeffect, we need to look at the chargedistribution of a dielectric at themolecular level.The molecules of a substance may bepolar or non-polar. In a non-polarmolecule, the centres of positive andnegative charges coincide. The moleculethen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipolemoment. Examples of non-polar moleculesare oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2)molecules which, because of theirsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On theother hand, a polar molecule is one in whichthe centres of positive and negative chargesare separated (even when there is noexternal field). Such molecules have apermanent dipole moment. An ionicmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water(H2O) are examples of polar molecules.FIGURE  2.20  Difference in behaviourof a conductor and a dielectricin an external electric field.FIGURE  2.21  Some examples of polarand non-polar molecules.2024-25"
33 Electric Currents in Conductors,"Physics66In an external electric field, thepositive and negative charges of a non-polar molecule are displaced in oppositedirections. The displacement stops whenthe external force on the constituentcharges of the molecule is balanced bythe restoring force (due to internal fieldsin the molecule). The non-polar moleculethus develops an induced dipole moment.The dielectric is said to be polarised bythe exter nal field. W e consider only thesimple situation when the induced dipolemoment is in the direction of the field andis proportional to the field strength.(Substances for which th is assumptionis true are called linear isotropicdielectrics. ) The induced dipole momentsof different molecules add up giving a netdipole moment of the dielectric in thepresence of the external field.A dielectric with polar molecules alsodevelops a net dipole moment in anexternal field, but for a different reason.In the absence of any external field, thedifferent permanent dipoles are orientedrandomly due to thermal agitation; sothe total dipole moment is zero. Whenan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to alignwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a netdipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric ispolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength oftwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the externalfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tendingto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipolemoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignmenteffect is more important for polar molecules.Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar , a dielectric developsa net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipolemoment per unit volume is called polarisation  and is denoted by P. Forlinear isotropic dielectrics,0ε χ=P Ee (2.37)where ce is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as theelectric susceptibility  of the dielectric medium.It is possible to relate ce to the molecular properties of the substance,but we shall not pursue that here.The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the originalexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangulardielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of itsfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. ThusFIGURE  2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipolemoment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polarmolecules, (b) Polar molecules.2024-25"
34 Ohm’s law,"Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance67every volume element Dv of the slab has a dipole momentP Dv in the direction of the field. The volume element Dv  ismacroscopically small but contains a very large number ofmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, thevolume element Dv has no net charge (though it has netdipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of onedipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.However , at the sur faces of the dielectric nor mal to theelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seenin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remainunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends atthe left surface. The unbalanced charges are the inducedcharges due to the external field.Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two chargedsurfaces with induced surface charge densities, say spand – sp. Clearly, the field produced by these surface chargesopposes the external field. The total field in the dielectricis, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric ispresent. We should note that the surface charge density±sp arises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.2.11  C APACITORS AND C APACITANCEA capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentialsV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Qand – Q, with potential difference V = V1 – V2 between them. We shallconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even asingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other atinfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to thetwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, thoughthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  ofthe capacitor  is zero.The electric field in the region between theconductors is proportional to the charge Q. Thatis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,the electric field will also be doubled at every point.(This follows from the direct proportionalitybetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’slaw and the superposition principle.) Now,potential difference V is the work done per unitpositive charge in taking a small test charge fromthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.Consequently, V is also proportio nal to Q, and theratio Q/V is a constant:QCV= (2.38)The constant C is called the capacitance  of the capacitor. C is independentof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on theFIGURE  2.23  A uniformlypolarised dielectric amountsto induced surface chargedensity, but no volumecharge density.FIGURE  2.24 A system of two conductorsseparated by an insulator for ms a capacitor .2024-25Physics68geometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of twoconductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of theinsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit ofcapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitorwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as - --||---, while the one withvariable capacitance is shown as  .Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. Thismeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of chargeQ at a r elatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potentialdifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strongelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges soproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the chargeon the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of thecapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of theintervening medium.The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstandwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectricstrength ; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation betweenconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potentialdifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor tostore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance shouldbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electricfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limitto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor withoutsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most commonunits are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,etc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of mostac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.2.12  T HE PARALLEL  PLATE CAPACITORA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conductingplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take theintervening medium between the plates to bevacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium betweenthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A bethe area of each plate and d the separation betweenthem. The two plates have charges Q and – Q. Sinced is much smaller than the linear dimension of theplates ( d2 << A), we can use the result on electricfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surfacecharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surfacecharge density s = Q/A and plate 2 has a surfacecharge density – s. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric fieldin different regions is:Outer region I (region  above the plate 1),0 002 2Eσ σε ε= − = (2.39)FIGURE  2.25  The parallel plate capacitor .2024-25"

For plates with finite area, this will not be true nearthe outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at theedges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, s willnot be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [ E and s are related by Eq.(2.35).] However , for d2 << A, these ef fects can be ignor ed in the r egionssufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41).Now for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electricfield times the distance between the plates, that is,01QdV E dAε= = (2.42)The capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is thenQCV= = 0Adε= (2.43)which, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system.

As before, wehave two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. Thecharge on the plates is ± Q, corresponding to the charge density ± s (withs = Q/A). When there is vacuum between the plates,00Eσε=Factors affecting capacitance, capacitors in actionInteractive Java tutorialhttp://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/java/capacitance/2024-25Physics70and the potential difference  V0 isV0 = E0dThe capacitance C0 in this case is0 00Q ACV dε= = (2.46)Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupyingthe intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, asexplained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface chargedensities sp and – sp. The electric field in the dielectric then correspondsto the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is ±( s – sp).That is,0PEσ σε−= (2.47)so that the potential difference across the plates is0PV E d dσ σε−= = (2.48)For linear dielectrics, we expect sp to be proportional to E0, i.e., to s.Thus, ( s – sp) is proportional to s  and we can writePKσσ σ− = (2.49)wher e K is a constant characteristic of the dielectric. Clearly,  K > 1.

As remarked before,from Eq. (2.49), it is clear that K is greater than 1. From Eqs. (2.46) and(2. 51)0CKC= (2.54)Thus, the dielectric constant of a substance is the factor (>1) by whichthe capacitance increases from its vacuum value, when the dielectric isinserted fully between the plates of a capacitor . Though we arrived at2024-25Electrostatic Potentialand Capacitance71 EXAMPLE  2.8Eq. (2.54)  for the case of a parallel plate capacitor , it holds good for anytype of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition ofthe dielectric constant of a substance.Example 2.8  A slab of material of dielectric constant K has the samearea as the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor but has a thickness(3/4) d, where d is the separation of the plates. How is the capacitancechanged when the slab is inserted between the plates?Solution Let  E0 = V0/d be the electric field between the plates whenthere is no dielectric and the potential difference is V0.

The effectivecapacitance depends on the way the individualcapacitors are combined. Two simplepossibilities are discussed below.2.14.1  Capacitors in seriesFigure 2.26 shows capacitors C1 and C2combined in series.The left plate of C1 and the right plate of C2are connected to two terminals of a battery andhave charges Q and – Q , respectively. It thenfollows that the right plate of C1 has charge – Qand the left plate of C2  has charge Q. If this wasnot so, the net charge on each capacitor wouldnot be zero. This would result in an electric fieldin the conductor connecting C1and C2. Chargewould flow until the net charge on both C1 andC2 is zero and there is no electric field in theconductor connecting C1 and C2. Thus, in theseries combination, charges on the two plates(±Q) are the same on each capacitor . The totalFIGURE  2.26  Combination of twocapacitors in series.FIGURE  2.27   Combination of ncapacitors in series.2024-25Physics72potential drop V across the combination is the sum of the potential dropsV1 and V2 across C1 and C2, respectively .V = V1 + V2 = 1 2Q QC C+ (2.55)i.e., 1 21 1 VQ C C= + , (2.56)Now we can regard the combination as an effective capacitor withcharge Q and potential dif ference V.

In this case, the same potential difference isapplied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges(±Q1) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (± Q2) on thecapacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:Q1 = C1V, Q2 = C2V (2.61)The equivalent capacitor is one with chargeQ = Q1 + Q2(2.62)and potential dif ference V.Q = CV = C1V + C2V (2.63)The effective capacitance C is, from Eq.

Bycharge conservation, conductor 2 has charge – Q atthe end (Fig 2.30 ) .In transferring positive charge from conductor 2to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since atany stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential thanconductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we firstcalculate the work done in a small step involvingtransfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situationwhen the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q¢ and–Q¢ respectively. At this stage, the potential differenceV¢ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q¢/C, where C is thecapacitance of the system. Next imagine that a smallcharge d Q¢ is transferr ed from conductor 2 to 1.

Charges in a conductor canreside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surfaceof a conductor . In a cavity within a conductor (with no char ges), theelectric field is zero.9. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator . Itscapacitance is defined by C = Q/V , where Q and –Q are the charges on thetwo conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C isdetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relativepositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,1 F = 1 C V–1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between theplates),C = 0Adεwhere A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.10.If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulatingsubstance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates inducesa net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field insidethe dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates isthus reduced.

But if there is aforce on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking ofelectrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that eachcharge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes thenet Coulomb force on the charge.2.A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines withina small region of space.

312 Kirchhoff’s Rules,"3.1  I NTRODUCTIONIn Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be atrest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occurnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon inwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is notsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flowin a steady manner , like water flowing smoothly in a river . A tor ch and acell-driven clock ar e examples of such devices. In the pr esent chapter , weshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.3.2  E LECTRIC  CURRENTImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Boththe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backwardacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount ( i.e.,forward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forwarddirection across the area. Similarly, let q– be the net amount of negativecharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amountof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the timeinterval t, then, is q = q+– q–. This is proportional to t for steady currentChapter ThreeCURRENTELECTRICITY2024-25Physics82and the quotientqIt= (3.1)is defined to be the current  across the area in the forward direction. (If itturn out to be a negative number , it implies a curr ent in the backwar ddirection.)Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we definethe current as follows. Let DQ be the net charge flowing across a cross-section of a conductor during the time interval Dt [i.e., between times tand ( t + Dt)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of theconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of DQ to Dt in the limit of Dttending to zero,()0limtQI tt Δ →Δ≡Δ(3.2)In SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is definedthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the followingchapter . An amper e is typically the or der of magnitude of curr ents indomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the orderof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents inour nerves are in microamperes.3.3 E LECTRIC  CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORSAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it isfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, freecharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called theionospher e. However , in atoms and molecules, the negatively char gedelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other andare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, agram of water , for example, contains appr oximately 1022 molecules. Thesemolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attachedto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In othermaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to movewithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightlybound to each other so that the current is carried by the negativelycharged electr ons. Ther e are, however , other types of conductors likeelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that thecurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the backgroundof fixed positive ions.Consider first the case when no electric field is present. The electronswill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with thefixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speedas befor e the collision. However , the dir ection of its velocity after thecollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferentialdirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the2024-25CurrentElectricity83number of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the numberof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no netelectric current.Let us now see what happens to such apiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.To focus our thoughts, imagine the conductorin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).Suppose we now take two thin circular discsof a dielectric of the same radius and putpositive charge + Q distributed over one discand similarly – Q at the other disc. W e attachthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of thecylinder . An electric field will be cr eated andis directed from the positive towards thenegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as longas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in thesituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and nocurrent ther eafter .We can also imagine a mechanism wher e the ends of the cylinder ar esupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised byelectr ons moving inside the conductor . In that case, ther e will be a steadyelectric field in the body of the conductor . This will r esult in a continuouscurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,which maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shallstudy  later in this chapter . In the next sections, we shall study the steadycurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.3.4  O HM’S LAWA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currentswas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowingand let V be the potential dif ference between the ends of the conductor .Then Ohm’s law states that     V µ Ior, V = R I (3.3)where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance  of theconductor . The SI units of r esistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbolW. The r esistance R not only depends on the material of the conductorbut also on the dimensions of the conductor . The dependence of R on thedimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.Consider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab oflength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two suchidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of thecombination is 2 l. The current flowing through the  combination is thesame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potentialdifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potentialdifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab isFIGURE  3.1 Charges + Q and – Q put at the endsof a metallic cylinder . The electr ons will driftbecause of the electric field created toneutralise the charges. The current thuswill stop after a while unless the charges + Qand – Q are continuously replenished.FIGURE  3.2Illustrating therelation R = rl/A fora rectangular slabof length l and areaof cross-section A.2024-25"
313 Wheatstone Bridge,"Physics84identical to the first and the same current I flows throughboth. The potential difference across the ends of thecombination is clearly sum of the potential differenceacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2 V. Thecurrent through the combination is I and the resistanceof the combination RC is [from Eq. (3.3)],22CVR RI= = (3.4)since V/I = R , the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,doubling the length of a conductor doubles theresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional tolength,R l∝ (3.5)Next, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting itlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as acombination of two identical slabs of length l, but eachhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].For a given voltage V across the slab, if I  is the currentthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowingthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since thepotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,i.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of eachof the half-slabs R1 is1 2 2 .( /2)V VR RI I= = = (3.6)Thus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doublesthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportionalto the cross-sectional area,1RA∝ (3.7)Combining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we havelRA∝ (3.8)and hence for a given conductorlRAρ= (3.9)where the constant of proportionality r depends on the material of theconductor but not on its dimensions. r is called resistivity .Using the last equation, Ohm’s law readsI lV I RAρ= × = (3.10)Current per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is calledcurrent density  and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current densityare A/m2. Further , if E is the magnitude of unifor m electric field in theconductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across itsends is El. Using these, the last equation readsGEORG SIMON OHM (1787– 1854)Georg Simon Ohm  (1787–1854) German physicist,professor at Munich. Ohmwas led to his law by ananalogy between theconduction of heat: theelectric field is analogous tothe temperature gradient,and the electric current isanalogous to the heat flow.2024-25CurrentElectricity85        E l = j r lor,    E = j  r (3.11)The above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in avector  form. The current density, (which we have defined as the currentthrough unit ar ea normal to the curr ent) is also dir ected along E, and isalso a vector j (º ºº ºº j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,        E = jr (3.12)or,   j = s E (3.13)where s º1/r is called the conductivity . Ohm’s law is often stated in anequivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, wewill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from thecharacteristics of the drift of electrons.3.5DRIFT OF ELECTRONS  AND THE O RIGINOF RESISTIVITYAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixedions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in randomdirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will bezero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons andthe velocity of the ith electron ( i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is vi, then101Niiv==∑N(3.14)Consider now the situation when an electric field ispresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to thisfield by=– Eaem(3.15)where – e is the charge and  m is the mass of an electron.Consider again the ith electron at a given time t. Thiselectron would have had its last collision some timebefore t, and let ti be the time elapsed after its lastcollision. If vi was its velocity immediately after the lastcollision, then its velocity Vi at time t is−  = +     EV vi i ietm(3.16)since starting with its last collision it was accelerated(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for atime interval ti. The average velocity of the electrons attime t is the average of all the Vi’s. The average of vi’s iszero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,the direction of the velocity of an electron is completelyrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur atregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote byt, the average time between successive collisions. Thenat a given time, some of the electrons would have spentFIGURE  3.3 A schematic picture ofan electron moving from a point A toanother point B through repeatedcollisions, and straight line travelbetween collisions (full lines). If anelectric field is applied as shown, theelectron ends up at point B ¢ (dottedlines). A slight drift in a directionopposite the electric field is visible.2024-25Physics86time more than t and some less than t. In other words, the time ti inEq. (3.16) will be less than t for some and more than t for others as we gothrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of ti then is t(known as relaxation time ). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over theN-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity vd( ) ( ) ( ) ≡ = −Ev V vd i i i average average averageetm0 –τ τ = =−E Ee em m(3.17)This last result is surprising. It tells us that theelectrons move with an average velocity which isindependent of time, although electrons areaccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and thevelocity vd in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity .Because of the drift, there will be net transport ofcharges across any area perpendicular to E. Considera planar area A, located inside the conductor such thatthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Thenbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of timeDt, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto|vd|Dt would have crossed the area. If n is the numberof free electrons per unit volume in the metal, thenthere are n Dt |vd|A such electrons. Since eachelectron carries a charge – e, the total charge transported across this areaA to the right in time Dt is –ne A|vd|Dt. E is directed towards the left andhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative ofthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time Dt is by definition[Eq. (3.2)]  I Dt, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,v Δ = + Δd I t n e A t (3.18)Substituting the value of | vd| from Eq. (3.17)2Eτ Δ = Δe AI t n tm(3.19)By definition I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density byI = |j| A (3.20)Hence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),2j Eτ=nem(3.21)The vector j is parallel to E and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in thevector form2τ=j Enem(3.22)Comparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm’slaw, if we identify the conductivity s  asFIGURE  3.4 Current in a metallicconductor . The magnitude of curr entdensity in a metal is the magnitude ofcharge contained in a cylinder of unitarea and length vd.2024-25CurrentElectricity87 EXAMPLE  3.12nemσ τ= (3.23)We thus see that a very simple pictur e of electrical conductionreproduces Ohm’s law. W e have, of course, made assumptions that tand n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,discuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.Example 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conductionelectrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10–7 m2 carryinga current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughlyone conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 103 kg/m3,and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtainedabove with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinarytemperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along theconductor which causes the drift motion.Solution(a)The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is oppositeto the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the directionof increasing potential. The drift speed vd is given by Eq. (3.18)vd  = (I/neA)Now, e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, A = 1.0 × 10–7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density ofconduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubicmetre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as isreasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metreof copper has a mass of 9.0 × 103 kg. Since 6.0 × 1023 copperatoms have a mass of 63.5 g,236 6.0 109.0 1063.5n×= × ×   = 8.5 × 1028 m–3which gives,28 –19 –71.58.5 10 1.6 10 1.0 10=× × × × ×dv    = 1.1 × 10–3 m s–1  = 1.1 mm s–1(b)(i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed * of a copper atom ofmass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv2 > = (3/2) kBT ] and is thustypically of the order of /Bk T M , where kB is the Boltzmannconstant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 102 m/s. Thisfigure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atomsin a conductor . Note that the drift speed of electr ons is muchsmaller , about 10–5 times the typical ther mal speed at or dinarytemperatures.(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed ofan electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 108 m s–1(You will lear n about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, incomparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10–11.*See Eq. (12.23) of Chapter 12 from Class XI book.2024-25Physics88 EXAMPLE  3.2Example 3.2(a)In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only afew mm s–1 for currents in the range of a few amperes? How thenis current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?(b)The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electronsin the electric field inside the conductor . But for ce should causeacceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady averagedrift speed?(c)If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge issmall, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in aconductor?(d)When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,does it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are movingin the same direction?(e)Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successivecollisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence ofelectric field, (ii) presence of electric field?Solution(a)Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electrondrift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electronsfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However ,it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.(b)Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed untilit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speedafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speedagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.(c)Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,~1029 m–3.(d)By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the largerandom velocities of electrons.(e)In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in thepresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.3.5.1  MobilityAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. Inmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, theyare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can beboth positive and negative ions.An important quantity is the mobility  m defined as the magnitude ofthe drift velocity per unit electric field:| |dEµ=v(3.24)The SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practicalunits (cm2/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq. (3.17), we havevd = τe Em2024-25CurrentElectricity89Hence,τµ= =dveE m(3.25)where t is the average collision time for electrons.3.6  L IMITATIONS OF OHM’S LAWAlthough Ohm’s law has been found valid over a large classof materials, there do exist materials and devices used inelectric circuits where the proportionality of V and I  does nothold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the followingtypes:(a)V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).(b)The r elation between V and I depends on the sign of V. Inother words, if I is the current for a certain V , then reversingthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does notproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will studyin Chapter 14.(c)The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more thanone value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibitingsuch behaviour is GaAs.Materials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a fewsubsequent chapters, however , we will study the electrical curr ents inmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.3.7  R ESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS  MATERIALSThe materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulatorsdepending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.FIGURE  3.5 The dashed linerepresents the linear Ohm’slaw. The solid line is the voltageV versus current I for a goodconductor .FIGURE  3.6 Characteristic curveof a diode. Note the differentscales for negative and positivevalues of the voltage and current.FIGURE  3.7 Variation of curr entversus voltage for GaAs.2024-25Physics90Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10–8 Wm to 10–6 Wm. At theother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics havingresistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the twoare the semiconductors. These, however , have r esistivitiescharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivitiesof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitableimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors forelectronic devices.3.8 TEMPERA TURE DEPENDENCE  OF RESISTIVITYThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature.Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures.Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivityof a metallic conductor is approximately given by,rT = r0 [1 + a (T–T0)] (3.26)where rT is the resistivity at a temperature T and r0 is the same at areference temperature T0. a is called the temperature co-efficient ofresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)–1.For  metals, a is positive.The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of rT plotted against Twould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,however , deviates considerably fr om a straight line (Fig. 3.8).Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited rangeof T around any reference temperature T0, where the graph can beapproximated as a straight line.FIGURE  3.8Resistivity rT ofcopper as a functionof temperature T.FIGURE  3.9 ResistivityrT of nichrome as afunction of absolutetemperature  T.FIGURE  3.10Temperature dependenceof resistivity for a typicalsemiconductor .Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron andchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature(Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. Thesematerials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors sincetheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.2024-25"
41 Introduction,"CurrentElectricity91 EXAMPLE  3.3Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease withincreasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.We can qualitatively understand the temperatur e dependence ofresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,resistivity of a material is given by21 mn eρσ τ= = (3.27)r thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unitvolume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increasetemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers ofcurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average timeof collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciableextent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperaturecauses r to increase as we have observed.For insulators and semiconductors, however , n incr eases withtemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t inEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature.Example 3.3  An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heatingelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, itsresistance at r oom temperatur e (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 W. Whenthe toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, aftera few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steadytemperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficientof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature rangeinvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.Solution   When the current through the element is very small, heatingeffects can be ignored and the temperature T1 of the element is thesame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to thesupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady valueof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperaturewill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slightdecrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reachedwhen temperatur e will rise no further , and both the r esistance of theelement and the current drawn will achieve steady values. Theresistance R2 at the steady temperature T2 isR2 230 V85.82.68 A= = ΩUsing the relationR2 = R1 [1 + a (T2 – T1)]with a = 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1, we getT2 – T1 –4(85.8 – 75.3)(75.3) 1.70 10=× ×  = 820 °Cthat is,  T2 = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °CThus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heatingeffect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is847 °C.2024-25"

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V(A)and V(B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V(A) > V(B)and the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.In a time interval Dt, an amount of charge DQ = I Dt travels from A toB. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V(A) andsimilarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy DUpot isDUpot = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy         = DQ[(V (B) – V (A)] = – DQ V         = – I VDt < 0 (3.28)If char ges moved without collisions thr ough the conductor , theirkinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.Conservation of total energy would then imply that,DK =  – DUpot(3.29)that is,DK = I VDt > 0 (3.30)Thus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor underthe action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as theymove. W e have, however , seen earlier that on the average, char ge carriersdo not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This isbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. Duringcollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,in an actual conductor , an amount of ener gy dissipated as heat in theconductor during the time interval Dt is,DW = I VDt (3.31)The energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipatedP = DW/Dt  and we have,P = I V (3.32)2024-25CurrentElectricity93Using Ohm’s law V = IR , we getP = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)as the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying acurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of anelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.Where does the power come from? As we havereasoned before, we need an external source to keepa steady curr ent thr ough the conductor . It is clearlythis sour ce which must supply this power . In thesimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is thechemical energy of the cell which supplies this powerfor as long as it can.The expr essions for power , Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),show the dependence of the power dissipated in aresistor R on the current through it and the voltageacross it.Equation (3.33) has an important application topower transmission. Electrical power is transmittedfrom power stations to homes and factories, whichmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmissioncables. One obviously wants to minimise the powerloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homesand factories. W e shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider adevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cableshaving a resistance Rc to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltageacross R and I the current through it, thenP = V I (3.34)The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finiteresistance Rc. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which iswasted is Pc  withPc = I2 Rc   22cP RV= (3.35)from Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in theconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cablesfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc isconsiderable. To reduce Pc, these wires carry current at enormous valuesof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmissionlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Usingelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a devicecalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.3.10 C ELLS, EMF, INTERNAL  RESIST ANCEWe have alr eady mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steadycurrent in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell hastwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown inFIGURE  3.11  Heat is produced in theresistor R which is connected acrossthe terminals of a cell. The energydissipated in the resistor R comes fromthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.2024-25Physics94Fig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped inthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.The positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) betweenitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it markedA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negativepotential  – ( V– ) (V– ≥ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,marked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolytehas the same potential throughout, so that the potential differencebetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called theelectromotive force  (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thuse = V++V– >  0 (3.36)Note that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force . Thename emf, however , is used because of historical r easons, and wasgiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.To understand the significance of e, consider a resistor Rconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across Rfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintainedbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,across the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolytebut fr om N to P , wher eas thr ough R, it flows fr om P to N.The electrolyte through which a current flows has a finiteresistance r, called the inter nal r esistance . Consider first thesituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is thepotential difference between P and N. Now,V = Potential difference between P and A       + Potential difference between A and B       + Potential  difference between B and N   = e (3.37)Thus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive andnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current isflowing through the cell.If however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential differencebetween P and N isV = V++ V– – I r   = e – I r (3.38)Note the negative sign in the expression ( I r) for the potential differencebetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in theelectrolyte.In  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuitmay be neglected when the  curr ent I is such that e >> I r. The actualvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internalresistance of dry cells, however , is much higher than the commonelectrolytic cells.We also observe that since V is the potential dif ference acr oss R, wehave from Ohm’s lawV = I  R (3.39)Combining Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39), we getFIGURE  3.12  (a) Sketch ofan electrolyte cell withpositive terminal P andnegative terminal N. Thegap between the electrodesis exaggerated for clarity. Aand B are points in theelectrolyte typically close toP and N. (b) the symbol fora cell, + referring to P and– referring to the Nelectrode. Electricalconnections to the cell aremade at P and N.2024-25CurrentElectricity95I  R   =  e – I  rOr, IR r=+ε(3.40)The maximum current that can be drawn from a cell is for R = 0 andit is Imax = e/r. However , in most cells the maximum allowed curr ent ismuch lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.3.11  CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLELLike resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. Andlike resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.FIGURE  3.13  Two cells of emf’s e1 and e2 in the series. r1, r2 are theirinternal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combinationcan be considered as one cell of emf eeq and an internal resistance req.Consider first  two cells in series (Fig. 3.13), where one terminal of thetwo cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.e1, e2 are the emf’s of the two cells and r1, r2 their internal resistances,respectively.Let V (A), V (B), V (C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown inFig. 3.13. Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positiveand negative ter minals of the first cell. W e have alr eady calculated it inEq. (3.38) and hence,V V V I rAB A B≡ =( )□ ( ) □ ε1 1 (3.41)Similarly,V V V I rBC B C≡ =( )□ ( ) □ ε2 2 (3.42)Hence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of thecombination is()()()()AC (A)– (C) A – B B – C V V V V V V V≡ = +                ()()1 2 1 2 –I r r ε ε= + + (3.43)If we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A andC of emf eeq and internal resistance req, we would haveVAC = eeq– I req(3.44)Comparing the last two equations, we get  eeq = e1 + e2(3.45)and  req = r1 + r2(3.46)In Fig.3.13, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to thepositive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,2024-25"

(3.42) would change to VBC = –e2–Ir2 and we will geteeq = e1 – e2         ( e1 > e2) (3.47)The rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any numberof cells:(i)The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum oftheir individual emf’s, and(ii)The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells isjust the sum of their internal resistances.This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positiveelectrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell fromthe negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expressionfor eeq with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14).I1 and I2 are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of thecells. At the point B1, I1 and I2 flow in whereas the current I flowsout. Since as much charge flows in as out, we haveI = I1 + I2(3.48)Let V (B1) and V (B2) be the potentials at B1 and B2, respectively.Then, considering the first cell, the potential difference across itsterminals is V (B1) – V (B2). Hence, from Eq. (3.38)()()1 2 1 1 1 – – V V B V B I r ε ≡ = (3.49)Points B1 and B2 are connected exactly similarly to the secondcell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have()()1 2 2 2 2 – – V V B V B I r ε ≡ = (3.50)Combining the last three equations1 2    I I I= +    = + = ++ε ε ε ε11221122 1 21 1 – ––VrVr r rVr r(3.51)Hence, V is given by,1 2 2 1 1 21 2 1 2–r r r rV Ir r r rε ε+=+ +(3.52)If we want to replace the combination by a single cell, between B1 andB2, of emf eeq and internal resistance req, we would haveV = eeq – I req(3.53)The last two equations should be the same and hence1 2 2 11 2eqr rr rε εε+=+(3.54)1 21 2eqr rrr r=+(3.55)We can put these equations in a simpler way,FIGURE  3.14  Two cells inparallel.

Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules ,are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by asymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flowsalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determinedto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of thearrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a directionopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some othersource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,as well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing throughthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; Ihere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labellingthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of courseV = e + I r (3.60)Having clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:(a) Junction rule:  At any junction, the sum of the currents enteringthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction(Fig. 3.15).Gustav Robert  Kirchhoff(1824 – 1887)  Germanphysicist, professor atHeidelberg and atBerlin. Mainly known forhis development ofspectroscopy, he alsomade many importantcontributions to mathe-matical physics, amongthem, his first andsecond rules for circuits.GUST AV ROBER T KIRCHHOFF (1824 –2024-25Physics98 EXAMPLE  3.5This applies equally well if instead of a junction ofseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.The proof of this rule follows from the fact thatwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulationof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.Thus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rateat which charge flows into the junction), must equalthe total current flowing out.(b) Loop rule:  The algebraic sum of changes inpotential around any closed loop involvingresistors and cells in the loop is zero(Fig. 3.15).This rule is also obvious, since electric potential isdependent on the location of the point. Thusstarting with any point if we come back to the samepoint, the total change must be zero. In a closedloop, we do come back to the starting point andhence the rule.FIGURE  3.15  At junction a the currentleaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.The junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2. At pointh current entering is I1. There is only onecurrent leaving h and by junction rulethat will also be I1. For the loops ‘ahdcba’and ‘ahdefga’, the loop rules give –30 I1 –41 I3 + 45 = 0 and –30 I1 + 21 I2 – 80 = 0.Example 3.5  A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance isconnected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical networkconsisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 W (Fig. 3.16).

Ther e is, however , a clear symmetry in theproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance ofthe network.The paths AA ¢, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in thenetwork. Thus, the curr ent in each must be the same, say, I. Further ,at the corners A ¢, B and D, the incoming current I must split equallyinto the two outgoing branches. In this manner , the curr ent in allthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, usingKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC ¢EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s secondrule:–IR – (1/2) IR – IR + e = 0where R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery. Thus,e = 52I RThe equivalent resistance Req of the network is53 6eqR RIε= =For R = 1 W, Req = (5/6)  W and for e = 10 V, the total current (= 3 I) inthe network is3I = 10 V/(5/6)  W = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 AThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from theFig. 3.16.It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, thegreat power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3. 5.In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,and only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and closed loops(as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can wehandle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.Example 3.6  Determine the current in each branch of the networkshown in Fig. 3.17.FIGURE  3.172024-25Physics100 EXAMPLE  3.6Solution   Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown currentto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reducethe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff isused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.We then have thr ee unknowns I1, I2 and I3 which can be found byapplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.Kirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,10 – 4( I1– I2) + 2( I2 + I3 – I1) – I1 = 0 [3.61(a)]that is, 7 I1– 6I2 – 2I3 = 10For the closed loop ABCA, we get10 – 4 I2– 2 (I2 + I3) – I1 = 0that is, I1 + 6I2 + 2I3 =10 [3.61(b)]For the closed loop BCDEB, we get5 – 2 ( I2 + I3) – 2 ( I2 + I3 – I1) = 0that is, 2 I1 – 4I2 – 4I3 = –5 [3.61(c)]Equations (3.61 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in threeunknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to giveI1 = 2.5A,   I2 = 58 A,   I3 = 718  AThe currents in the various branches of the network areAB : 58 A,   CA : 122 A,   DEB : 718  AAD : 718 A,   CD : 0 A,   BC : 122 AIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to theremaining closed loops does not provide any additional independentequation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the secondrule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltagedrop over the closed loop BADEB55841584 V V V+ ×− ×equal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff’s second rule.3.13  W HEATSTONE  BRIDGEAs an application of Kirchhoff’s rules consider the circuit shown inFig. 3.18, which is called the Wheatstone bridge . The bridge hasfour resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4. Across one pair of diagonally oppositepoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This ( i.e., AC) iscalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, agalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. Thisline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. Ingeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as acurrent Ig through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced  bridgewher e the r esistors ar e such that Ig = 0. W e can easily get the balancecondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, theKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure )2024-25"

Let us suppose wehave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R4 isthus not known. Keeping known resistances R1 and R2 in the first andsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R3 till the galvanometer showsa null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balancecondition the value of the unknown resistance R4 is given by,24 31RR RR= [3.64(b)]A practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge .Example 3.7  The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.19) havethe following resistances:AB = 100 W, BC = 10 W, CD = 5W, and DA = 60 W.FIGURE  3.192024-25Physics102 EXAMPLE  3.7 A galvanometer of 15 W resistance is connected across BD.

(3.65b) by 1020I1 – 60 Ig – 10 I2 = 0 [3.65(d)]From Eqs. (3.65d) and (3.65a) we have63Ig – 2I2 = 0I2 = 31.5 Ig[3.65(e)]Substituting the value of I2 into Eq. [3.65(c)], we get13 (31.5 Ig ) + Ig = 2410.5 Ig = 2Ig = 4.87 mA.SUMMARY1.Current  through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passingper unit time through the area.2.To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in whichan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potentialenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking thecharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminalof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, ofthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage differencebetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.3.Ohm’s law : The electric current I flowing through a substance isproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V µ I or V = RI,where R is called the resistance  of the substance. The unit of resistanceis ohm: 1 W = 1 V A–1.2024-25CurrentElectricity1034.The resistance  R of a conductor depends on its length l andcross-sectional area A through the relation,lRAρ=wher e r, called resistivity  is a pr operty of the material and depends ontemperature and pressure.5.Electrical resistivity  of substances varies over a very wide range. Metalshave low resistivity, in the range of 10–8 W m to 10–6 W m. Insulatorslike glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity.Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range ofresistivity on a logarithmic scale.6.In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in somecases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive andnegative ions carry the electric current.7.Current density  j gives the amount of charge flowing per second perunit area normal to the flow,j = nq vdwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of chargecarriers each of charge q, and vd is the drift velocity  of the chargecarriers. For electrons  q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional areaA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I throughthe area is nevd A.8.Using E = V/l, I = nevd A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains2deE nevm mρ=The proportionality between the force eE  on the electrons in a metaldue to the external field E and the drift velocity vd (not acceleration)can be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisionswith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisionsoccur on an average at a time interval t,vd = at = eE t/mwhere a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives2mneρτ=9.In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly withtemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity  a is defined asthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.10.Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamentallaw of nature. It fails if(a)V depends on I non-linearly.(b)the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the sameabsolute value of V.(c)The relation between V and I is non-unique.An example of (a) is when r increases with I (even if temperature iskept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows thefeature (c).11.When a source of emf e is connected to an external resistance R, thevoltage Vext across R is given byVext = IR = RR rε+where r is the internal resistance  of the source.2024-25Physics104Physical Quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit RemarkElectric current I [A] A SI base unitCharge Q, q [T A] CVoltage, Electric V [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char gepotential differenceElectromotive force e [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char geResistance R [M L2 T–3 A–2] W R = V /IResistivity r [M L3 T–3 A–2] W m R = rl/AElectrical s [M–1 L–3 T3 A2] S s = 1/ rconductivityElectric field E [M L T–3 A–1] V m–1 Electric forcechargeDrift speed vd[L T–1] m s–1vde Em=τRelaxation time t [T] sCurrent density j [L–2 A] A m–2current/areaMobility m [M L3 T–4 A–1]m2 V–1s–1/dv E12.Kirchhoff’s Rules –(a)Junction Rule: At any junction of circuit elements, the sum ofcurrents entering the junction must equal the sum of currentsleaving it.(b)Loop Rule:  The algebraic sum of changes in potential around anyclosed loop must be zero.13.The Wheatstone bridge  is an arrangement of four resistances – R1, R2,R3, R4 as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by3 12 4R RR R=using which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowingthe other three resistances.POINTS TO PONDER1.Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.Currents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is ascalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an areaof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:I =  j . DSwhere j and DS are vectors.2024-25"
47 The Solenoid,"CurrentElectricity1052.Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. Aresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion thatV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation definesresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whetherthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of Iversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.Equation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s  law, i.e., aconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of thematerial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of appliedelectric field.3.Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like puregermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law withinsome range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong,there are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.4.Motion of conduction electrons in electric field E is the sum of (i)motion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E. The motiondue to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute tovd (Chapter 10, Textbook of Class XI). vd , thus is only due to appliedelectric field on the electron.5.The relation j = ρ v should be applied to each type of charge carriersseparately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge densityarises from both positive and negative charges:j = ρ+ v+ + ρ– v–ρ ρρ ρρ = ρ+ + ρ–Now in a neutral wire carrying electric current,ρ ρρ ρρ+ = – ρ–Further, v+ ~ 0 which givesρ ρρ ρρ = 0j = ρ– vThus, the relation j = ρ v does not apply to the total current chargedensity.6.Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conservation of charge and theoutgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at ajunction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validityof Kirchhoff’s junction rule.EXERCISES3.1 The storage battery of a car has an emf of 12 V.

However , it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it wasrealised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstrationin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticedthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearbymagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He foundthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle whichhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to thewire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when thecurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that theearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of thecurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflectionincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to thewire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves inconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oerstedconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic fieldin the surrounding space .Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the lawsobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated byChapter FourMOVING CHARGESAND MAGNETISM2024-25"
49 Torque on Current Loop Magnetic Dipole,"Physics108James Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by  J.C.Bose andG. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. A  remarkable scientific andtechnological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due toour increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention ofdevices for production, amplification, transmission and detection ofelectromagnetic waves.In this chapter , we will see how magnetic field exertsforces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons,and curr ent-carrying wir es. W e shall also lear n howcurrents pr oduce magnetic fields. We shall see howparticles can be accelerated to very high energies in acyclotr on. W e shall study how curr ents and voltages ar edetected by a galvanometer .In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,we adopt the following convention:  A current or afield (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of thepaper is depicted by a dot ( ¤). A current or a field goinginto the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ( )*.Figures. 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) correspond to these twosituations, respectively.4.2  M AGNETIC F ORCE4.2.1  Sources and fieldsBefore we introduce the concept of a magnetic field B, weshall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 aboutthe electric field E. We have seen that the interactionbetween two charges can be considered in two stages.The charge Q, the source of the field, produces an electricfield E, whereFIGURE  4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carryingwire.

Thisdiscovery gave the firstempirical evidence of aconnection between electricand magnetic phenomena.HANS CHRISTIAN OERSTED  (1777– 1851)2024-25109Moving Charges andMagnetismE = Q ˆr/ (4pe0)r2(4.1)where ˆr is unit vector along r,  and  the field E is a vectorfield. A charge q interacts with this field and experiencesa force F given byF  =  q  E   = q Q ˆr  / (4pe0) r2(4.2)As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field E is not justan artefact but has a physical role. It can  convey  energyand momentum and is not established instantaneouslybut takes finite time to propagate. The concept of a fieldwas specially stressed by Faraday  and was incorporatedby Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism.In addition to depending on each point in space, it canalso vary with time, i.e., be a function of time.  In ourdiscussions in this chapter , we will assume that the fieldsdo not change with time.The field at a particular point can be due to one ormore charges. If there are more charges the fields addvectorially. Y ou have alr eady lear nt in Chapter 1 that thisis called the principle of superposition. Once the field isknown, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).Just as static charges produce an electric field, thecurrents or moving charges produce (in addition) amagnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector field. Ithas several basic properties identical to the electric field.It is defined at each point in space (and can in additiondepend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey theprinciple of superposition: the magnetic field of severalsources is the vector addition of magnetic field of eachindividual source .4.2.2  Magnetic Field,  Lorentz  ForceLet us suppose that there is  a point charge q (movingwith a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t) inpresence of both the electric field E (r) and the magneticfield B (r).  The force on an electric charge q due to bothof them can be written asF   = q [ E (r) +  v × B (r)] º Felectric +Fmagnetic(4.3)This force was given first  by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensiveexperiments of Amper e and others. It is called the Lorentz for ce. Youhave already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If welook at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the followingfeatures.(i)It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and themagnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on apositive charge.(ii)The magnetic force q [ v × B ] includes a vector product of velocityand magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magneticHENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ  (1853 – 1928)Hendrik Antoon Lorentz(1853  – 1928)  Dutchtheoretical physicist,professor at Leiden.  Heinvestigated  therelationship betweenelectricity, magnetism,  andmechanics. In order toexplain the observed effectof magnetic fields onemitters of light (Zeemaneffect), he postulated theexistence of electric chargesin the atom, for which hewas awarded the Nobel Prizein 1902. He derived a set oftransformation equations(known after him, asLorentz transformationequations) by some tangledmathematical arguments,but he was not aware thatthese equations hinge on anew concept of space andtime.2024-25Physics110field vanish (become zero) if  v elocity and magnetic field are parallelor anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicularto both the velocity and the magnetic field. Itsdirection  is given by the screw rule or right handrule  for vector (or cross) product as illustratedin Fig. 4.2.(iii) The magnetic force is zero if  charge is notmoving (as then | v|= 0).  Only a movingcharge feels the magnetic force.The expression for the magnetic force helpsus to define the unit of the magnetic field, if onetakes q, F and v, all to be unity in the forceequation F = q [ v × B ] =q v B sin q ˆn,  where q isthe angle between  v and B [see  Fig. 4.2 (a)]. Themagnitude of magnetic field B is 1 SI unit, whenthe force acting on a unit charge (1 C), movingperpendicular to B with a speed 1m/s,  is onenewton.Dimensionally, we have [ B] = [ F/qv] and the unitof B are Newton second / (coulomb metre).  This unit is called tesla (T)named after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. Asmaller  unit (non-SI) called gauss  (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. Theearth’s magnetic field is about 3.6 × 1 0–5 T.4.2.3  Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductorWe can extend the analysis for for ce due to magnetic field on a singlemoving ch arge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of aunifor m cross-sectional ar ea A and length l. We shall assume one kindof mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the numberdensity of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total numberof mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in thisconducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an averagedrift velocity vd (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magneticfield B, the force on these carriers is:F = (nlA)q vd ´ ´´ ´´ Bwher e q is the value of the char ge on  a carrier .  Now nq vd is the curr entdensity j and |( nq vd)|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussionof current and current density). Thus,F = [(nq vd )lA] × B = [ jAl ] ´ ´´´´ B   = Il ´´´ ´´ B (4.4)where l  is a vector of magnitude l , the length of the rod, and with a directionidentical to the curr ent I. Note that the curr ent I is not a vector . In the laststep leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from  j to l.Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is theexternal magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carryingrod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz forceon it by considerin g it as a collection of linear strips d lj and summingjjId × F BlThis summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.FIGURE  4.2 The direction of the magneticforce acting on a charged particle. (a) Theforce on a positively charged particle withvelocity v and making an angle q with themagnetic field B is given by the right-handrule. (b) A moving charged particle q isdeflected in an opposite sense to –q in thepresence of magnetic field.2024-25111Moving Charges andMagnetism EXAMPLE  4.1Example 4.1  A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carriesa current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontalmagnetic field B (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magneticfield?FIGURE  4.3Solution   From Eq. (4.4), we find that ther e is an upwar d force F, ofmagnitude IlB,.

The earth’s magnetic field is approximately4 × 10–5 T and we have ignored it.Example 4.2 If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive y-axisand the charged particle is moving along the positive x-axis (Fig. 4.4),which way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negativecharge), (b) a proton (positive charge).FIGURE  4.4Solution    The velocity v of particle is along the x-axis, while B, themagnetic field is along the y-axis, so v × B is along the z-axis (screwrule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along – zaxis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along + z axis. EXAMPLE  4.2Charged particles moving in a magnetic field.Interactive demonstration:http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~teb/optics/java/partmagn/index.html2024-25Physics1124.3  M OTION IN A MAGNETIC  FIELDWe will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving ina  magnetic field.  We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter5) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motionof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to thevelocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitudeof the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may bechanged). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,which can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thuscan transfer energy in addition to momentum.]We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a unifor m magneticfield. First consider the case of v perpendicular to  B.  Theperpendicular force, q v × B , acts as a centripetal force andproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.The particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicularto each other (Fig. 4.5).If velocity has a component along B , this componentremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field willnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a planeperpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producinga helical motion  (Fig. 4.6).You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI,Chapter 3) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,then a force of  m v2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towardsthe centre of the circle, and is called the  centripetal force. If thevelocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the  magneticforce is  perpendicular to both  v and B and actslike a centripetal force. It has a magnitude q vB. Equating the two expressions for centripetalforce,m v 2/r = q v B, which givesr =  m v / qB (4.5)for the radius of the circle described by thecharged particle. The larger the  momentum,  thelarger is the radius and bigger the circledescribed. If ω is the angular frequency, then   v= ω  r. So,ω  = 2π ν =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]which is independent of the velocity or energy .Here ν is the frequency of rotation. Theindependence of ν from energy has importantapplication in the design of a cyclotron (seeSection 4.4.2).The time taken for one revolution is T= 2π/ω≡ 1/ν. If there is a  component of the velocityparallel to the magnetic field (denoted by v||), it will make the particleFIGURE  4.5 Circular motionFIGURE  4.6 Helical motion2024-25"

What is itsfrequency?  Calculate its energy in  keV. ( 1 eV = 1.6  × 10–19 J).Solution  Using Eq.

The distance moved along the magnetic field  in one rotation iscalled pitch p.  Using Eq.

It is given by the Biot-Savart’s  law.Fig. 4.7 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consideran infinitesimal element d l of the conductor. The magnetic fielddB due to this element is to be determined at a point P which is ata distance r from it. Let θ be the angle between d l and thedisplacement vector r. According to Biot-Savart’s law, themagnitude of the magnetic field d B is proportional to the currentI, the element length |d l|, and inversely proportional to the squareof the distance r. Its direction * is perpendicular to the planecontaining d l and r . Thus, in vector notation,dI drBr∝×l3           =×µ034πI drlr [4.7(a)]where µ0/4π is a constant of proportionality. The above expressionholds when the medium is vacuum.FIGURE  4.7 Illustration ofthe Biot-Savart law. Thecurrent element I dlproduces a field d B at adistance r. The ⊗ signindicates that thefield is perpendicularto the plane of thispage and directedinto it.*The sense of  d l×r is also given by the Right Hand Screw rule  : Look at theplane containing vectors d l and r. Imagine moving from the first vector towardssecond vector. If the movement is anticlockwise, the resultant is towards you.If it is clockwise, the resultant is away from you.2024-25Physics114 EXAMPLE  4.4The magnitude of this field is,µ θ=π02d sind4I lrB [4.7(b)]where we have used the property of cross-product. Equation [4.7 (a)]constitutes our basic equation for the magnetic field.  The proportionalityconstant in SI units has the exact value,7 010 Tm/A4µ−=π[4.7(c)]We call µ0 the permeability of free space (or vacuum).The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities, aswell as, differences with the Coulomb’s law for the electrostatic field. Someof these are:(i)Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square ofdistance from the source to the point of interest. The principle ofsuperposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note thatthe magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostaticfield is linear in its source: the electric charge.](ii)The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electriccharge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl.(iii)The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining thesource and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to theplane containing the displacement vector r and the current element I dl.(iv)There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is notpresent  in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.7, the magnetic field at anypoint in  the direction of d l (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,θ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq. [4.7(a)], |d B| = 0.There is an interesting  relation between ε0, the permittivity of freespace; µ0, the permeability of free space; and c , the speed of light in vacuum:( )00 0 0 44µε µ ε  = π     π ( )791109 10−   =    ×8 2 21 1(3 10 ) c= =×We will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on theelectromagnetic waves. Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant,the product µ0ε0 is fixed in magnitude. Choosing the value of either ε0 orµ0, fixes the value of the other. In SI units, µ0 is fixed to  be equal to4π × 10–7 in magnitude.Example 4.4  An element ˆ ∆ = ∆ xi l  is placed at the origin and carriesa large current I = 10 A (Fig. 4.8).

The evaluation entailssumming up the effect of infinitesimal current elements(I dl) mentioned in the previous section. We assume thatthe current I is steady and that the evaluation is carriedout in free space (i.e., vacuum).Fig. 4.9 depicts a circular loop carrying a steadycurrent I. The loop is placed in the  plane with itscentre at the origin O and has a radius R. The  x-axis isthe axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magneticfield at the point P on this axis. Let x be the distance of Pfrom the centre O of the loop.Cons ider a conducting element d l of the loop. This isshown in Fig. 4. 9. The magnitude d B of the magneticfield due to d l is given by the Biot-Savart law [Eq. 4. 7(a)],034=× rI ddBrµπl(4.8)Now r2 = x2 + R2 . Further, any element of the loopwill be perpendicular to the displacement vector fromthe element to the axial point. For example, the element d l in Fig. 4.9 isin the  plane, whereas, the displacement vector r from dl  to the  axialpoint P is in the  plane. Hence | dl × r|=r dl. Thus, ( )π02 2dd4I lBx Rµ=+(4.9)FIGURE  4.9 Magnetic field on theaxis of a current carrying circularloop of radius R. Shown are themagnetic field dB (due to a lineelement dl ) and itscomponents along andperpendicular to the axis. EXAMPLE  4.42024-25Physics116The direction of d B is shown in Fig. 4.9. It is perpendicular to theplane formed by d l and r. It has an x-component d Bx and a componentperpendicular to x-axis, d B⊥. When the components perpendicular tothe x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.For example, the d B⊥ component due to d l is cancelled by thecontribution due to the diametrically opposite d l element, shown inFig. 4.9. Thus, only the x-component survives. The net contribution alongx-direction can be obtained by integrating d Bx  = dB cos θ over the loop.For Fig. 4.9,2 2 1/2cos( )Rx Rθ=+ (4.10)From Eqs.

The direction of the magnetic field is given by(another) right-hand thumb rule  stated below:Curl the palm of your right hand around the circular wire with thefingers pointing in the direction of the current. The right-hand thumbgives the direction of the magnetic field.FIGURE  4.10  The magnetic field lines for a current loop. The direction ofthe field is given by the right-hand thumb rule described in the text. Theupper side of the loop may be thought of as the north pole and the lowerside as the south pole of a magnet.2024-25117Moving Charges andMagnetism EXAMPLE  4.5Example 4.5  A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into asemi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.11(a).

(b) In what way the contributionto B from the semicircle differs from that of a circular loop and inwhat way does it resemble?  (c) Would your answer be different if thewire were bent into a semi-circular arc of the same radius but in theopposite way as shown in Fig. 4.11(b)?FIGURE  4.11Solution(a)dl and r for each element of the straight segments are parallel.Therefore, d l × r = 0. Straight segments do not contribute to|B|.(b)For all segments of the semicircular arc, d l × r are all parallel toeach other (into the plane of the paper). All such contributionsadd up in magnitude. Hence direction of B for a semicircular arcis given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of acircular loop. Thus B is 1.9  × 10–4 T normal to the plane of thepaper going into it.(c)Same magnitude of B but opposite in direction to that in (b).Example 4.6  Consider a tightly wound 100 turn coil of radius 10cm, carrying a current of 1 A.

Ampere’s circuital lawconsiders an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.12).The surface has current passing through it. We considerthe boundary to be made up of a number of small lineelements. Consider one such element of length dl. Wetake the value of the tangential component of themagnetic field, Bt, at this element and multiply it by theFIGURE  4.12 EXAMPLE  4.62024-25Physics118length of that element dl [Note: Btdl=B.dl]. All suchproducts are added together. We consider the limit as thelengths of elements get smaller and their number getslarger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s   lawstates that this integral is  equal to µ0 times the totalcurrent passing through  the surface,  i.e.,“B.dl = µ0I [4.13(a)]where I  is the total current through the surface. Theintegral is taken over the closed loop coinciding with theboundary C of the surface. The relation above involves asign-convention, given by the right-hand rule. Let thefingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense theboundary is traversed in the loop integral “B.dl. Thenthe direction of the thumb gives the sense in which thecurrent I  is regarded as positive.For several applications, a much simplified version ofEq. [4.13(a)] proves sufficient. We shall assume that, insuch cases, it is possible to choose the loop (calledan amperian loop ) such that at each point of theloop, either(i)B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constantB, or(ii)B is normal to the loop, or(iii)B vanishes.Now, let L be the length (part) of the  loop for which Bis tangential . Let Ie  be the current enclosed by the loop.Then, Eq. (4.13) reduces to,BL =µ0Ie[4.13(b)]When there is a system with a symmetry such as fora straight infinite current-carrying wire  in Fig. 4.13, theAmpere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magneticfield, much the same way Gauss’ law helps indetermination of the electric field. This is exhibited in theExample 4.8 below. The boundary of the loop chosen isa circle and magnetic field is tangential to thecircumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left handside of Eq. [4.13 (b)], B. 2 πr. We find that the magneticfield at a distance r outside the wire is tangential andgiven byB × 2πr  =  µ0 I,B = µ0  I/ (2πr) (4.14)The above result for the infinite wire  is interestingfrom several points of view.ANDRE AMPERE  (1775 –1836)Andre Ampere (1775 –1836) Andre Marie Amperewas a French physicist,mathematician and chemistwho founded the science ofelectrodynamics. Amperewas a child prodigywho mastered advancedmathematics by the age of12. Ampere grasped thesignificance of Oersted’sdiscovery. He carried out alarge series of experimentsto explore the relationshipbetween current electricityand magnetism. Theseinvestigations culminatedin 1827 with thepublication of the‘Mathematical Theory ofElectrodynamic Pheno-mena Deduced Solely fromExperiments’. He hypo-thesised that all magneticphenomena are due tocirculating electriccurrents. Ampere washumble and absent-minded. He once forgot aninvitation to dine with theEmperor Napoleon. He diedof pneumonia at the age of61. His gravestone bearsthe epitaph: Tandem Feli x(Happy at last).(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle ofradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same inmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field2024-25119Moving Charges andMagnetism EXAMPLE  4.7possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry . The field thatnormally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field formconcentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings formconcentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines  form closedloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originatefrom positive charges and end at negative charges. The expressionfor the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoreticaljustification to Oersted’s experiments.(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire isinfinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. Ittends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. Thefield is directly proportional to the current and inverselyproportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magneticfield due to a long wire. This rule, called the  right-hand rule *, is:Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointingin the dir ection of the curr ent. Y our fingers will curl ar ound in thedirection of the magnetic field.Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the samephysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is toBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’sand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuitallaw holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. Thefollowing example will help us understand what is meant by the termenclosed  current.Example 4.7  Figure 4.13 shows a long straight wire of a circularcross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I isuniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate themagnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.FIGURE  4.13*Note that there are two distinct  right-hand rules: One which gives the directionof B on the axis of current-loop and the other which gives direction of Bfor a straight conducting wire. Fingers and thumb play different roles inthe two.2024-25"

For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed inSection 4.5, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expressionB = µ0I/2R [Eq. (4.12)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the lawcan be conveniently applied. We shall use  it in the next section to calculate2024-25"
52 The Bar Magnet,"121Moving Charges andMagnetismthe magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very usefulmagnetic systems: the solenoid  and the toroid.4.7  T HE SOLENOIDWe shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that thesolenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wirewound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closelyspaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  The net magneticfield is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wiresare used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.Figure 4.1 5 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. Weshow a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner  in Fig. 4.1 5(a).Figure  4.15(b) show s the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. InFig. 4.1 5(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field  between twoneighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.1 5(b), we see that the field at theinterior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along theaxis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As theFIGURE  4.15  (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has beenstretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Noticehow the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.FIGURE  4.16 The magnetic field of a very long solenoid. We consider arectangular Amperian loop abcd to determine the field.2024-25Physics122 EXAMPLE  4.8solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.Figure 4.1 6 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoidapproaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The fieldinside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zeroas argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field componentis zero. Thus, these two sections  make no contribution. Let the field alongab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.Let n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total numberof turns is  nh. The enclosed current is,  Ie = I (n h), where I is the currentin the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.13 (b)]BL =  µ0Ie,    B h = µ0I (n h)B = µ0 n I (4.16)The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoidis commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in thenext chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron coreinside the solenoid.Example 4.8  A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and ismade up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is themagnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?Solution  The number of turns per unit length is,50010000.5n= =  turns/mThe length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus,  l/a = 50 i.e., l >> a.Hence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely, Eq. (4.20)B = µ0n I   = 4π × 10–7 × 103 × 5   = 6.28  × 10–3 TFIGURE  4.17 Two long straightparallel conductors carrying steadycurrents Ia and Ib and separated by adistance d. Ba is the magnetic fieldset up by conductor ‘a’ at conductor ‘b’.4.8 F ORCE BETWEEN  TWO PARALLELCURRENTS , THE AMPEREWe have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to aconductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savartlaw. Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic fieldwill exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. Thisfollows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logicalto expect that two current-carrying conductors placed neareach other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. Inthe period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of thismagnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude ofthe current, on the shape and size of the conductors, aswell as, the distances between the conductors. In thissection, we shall take the simple example of two parallelcurrent- carrying conductors, which will perhaps help usto appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.2024-25123Moving Charges andMagnetismFigure 4.17 shows two long parallel conductors a and b separatedby a distance d and carrying (parallel) currents Ia and Ib, respectively.The conductor ‘a’ produces,  the same magnetic field Ba at all pointsalong the conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the direction ofthis field is downwards (when the conductors are placed horizontally).Its magnitude is given by Eq. [4.15(a)] or from Ampere’s circuital law,02aaIBdµ=πThe conductor ‘b’ carrying a current Ib will experience a sidewaysforce due to the  field Ba. The direction of this force is towards theconductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as Fba, the force on asegment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given byEq. (4.4),=ba b aF I LB      µπ=02a bI ILd(4.17)It is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. Fromconsiderations similar to above we can find the force Fab, on a segment oflength L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It  is equal in magnitude to Fba,and directed towards ‘b’. Thus,Fba = –Fab(4.18)Note that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least forparallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that theBiot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance withNewton’s third Law *.We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same directionattract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repeleach other. Thus,Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (samesign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other.Let fba represent the magnitude of the force Fba per unit length. Then,from Eq. (4.17),π02a bbaI Ifdµ= (4.19)The above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one ofthe seven SI base units.*It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges inmotion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/orconductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanicsis conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds evenfor the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, providedthe momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.2024-25Physics124 EXAMPLE  4.9The ampere  is the value of that steady current which, when maintainedin each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligiblecross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produceon  each of these conductors a force equal to  2 × 10–7 newtons per metreof length.This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoreticaldefinition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magneticfield and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriategeometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measurethis mechanical force.The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined interms of the ampere.When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity ofcharge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).Example 4.9  The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic fieldat a certain place is 3.0 ×10–5 T and the direction of the field is fromthe geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straightconductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force perunit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and thedirection of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?Solution   F = Il × BF = IlB sinθThe force per unit length isf = F/l = I B sinθ(a)When the current is flowing from east to west,θ = 90°Hence,f = I B  = 1 × 3 × 10–5 = 3 × 10–5 N m–1This is larger than the value 2×10–7 Nm–1 quoted in the definitionof the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of theearth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardisingthe ampere.The direction of the force is downwards. This direction may beobtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.(b)When the current is flowing from south to north,θ = 0of = 0Hence there is no force on the conductor.4.9  T ORQUE  ON CURRENT  LOOP, MAGNETIC  DIPOLE4.9.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniformmagnetic fieldWe now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I andplaced in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does notexperience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electricdipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.11).2024-25125Moving Charges andMagnetismWe first consider the simple case when therectangular loop is placed such that the uniformmagnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This isillustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BCof the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loopand exerts a force F1 on it which is directed into theplane of the loop. Its magnitude is,F1 = I b BSimilarly, it exerts a force F2 on the arm CD and F2is directed out of the plane of the paper.F2 = I b B = F1Thus, the net force  on the loop is zero . There is atorque on the loop due to the pair of forces F1 and F2.Figure 4.18(b) shows a view of the loop from the ADend. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotateit anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),1 22 2a aF Fτ= +( )2 2a aIbB IbB I ab B= + =    = I A B (4.20)where A = ab is the area of the rectangle.We next consider the case when the plane of the loop,is not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle withit. We take the angle between the field and the normal tothe coil to be angle θ (The previous case corresponds toθ = π/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act alongthe axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no netforce or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They tooare equal and opposite, with magnitude,F1 = F2 = I b BBut they are not collinear!  This results in a couple as before. Thetorque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop wasalong the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distancebetween the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.19(b) is a viewof the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forcesconstituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is,1 2 sin sin2 2a aF Fτ θ θ= += I ab B sin θ   = I A B sin θ (4.21)FIGURE  4.18  (a) A rectangularcurrent-carrying coil in uniformmagnetic field. The magnetic momentm points downwards. The torque τ ττ ττ isalong the axis and tends to rotate thecoil anticlockwise. (b) The coupleacting on the coil.2024-25"
53 Magnetism and Gauss’s Law,"Physics126 EXAMPLE  4.10As θ à 0, the perpendicular distance betweenthe forces of the couple also approaches zero. Thismakes the forces collinear and the net force andtorque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)can be expressed as vector product of the magneticmoment of the coil and the magnetic field.We define the magnetic moment of the currentloop as,m = I A (4.22)where the direction of the area vector A is givenby the right-hand thumb rule and is directed intothe plane of the paper in Fig. 4.18. Then as theangle between m and B is θ ,  Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)can be expressed by one expression(4.23)This  is analogous to the electrostatic case(Electric dipole of dipole moment pe in an electricfield E).τ=p E×eAs is clear from Eq. (4.22), the dimensions of themagnetic moment are [A][L2] and its unit is Am2.From Eq. (4.23), we see that the torque τ ττ ττvanishes when  m is either parallel or antiparallelto the magnetic field B. This indicates a state ofequilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (thisalso applies to any object with a magnetic momentm). When  m and B are parallel the equilibrium isa stable one. Any small rotation of the coilproduces a torque which brings it back to its original position. Whenthey are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation producesa torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence ofthis torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipolealigns itself with the external magnetic field.If the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.(4.23), still holds, withm = N I A (4.24)Example 4.10  A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10cm carries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of thecoil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about ahorizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magneticfield of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axisof the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through anangle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are themagnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position?(d) What is the angular speed acquired by the coil when it has rotatedby 90°? The moment of inertia of the coil is 0.1 kg m2.FIGURE 4.19  (a) The area vector of the loopABCD makes an arbitrary angle θ withthe magnetic field. (b) Top view ofthe loop. The forces F1 and F2 actingon the arms AB and CDare indicated.2024-25127Moving Charges andMagnetismEXAMPLE  4.11 EXAMPLE  4.10Solution(a)From Eq.

Thus, initial torque τi = 0. Finally, θ = π/2 (or 90 º).Thus, final torque τf = m B = 10 × 2 = 20 N m.(d) From Newton’s second law,I  where I  is the moment of inertia of the coil.

Show that in this orientation, the flux of2024-25Physics128 EXAMPLE  4.11the total field (external field + field produced by the loop) ismaximum. (c)A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an externalmagnetic field. If the wire is flexible, why does it change to acircular shape?Solution(a)No, because that would require τ ττ ττ to be in the vertical direction.But τ ττ ττ = I A × B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the verticaldirection, τ would be in the plane of the loop for any B.(b)Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector Aof the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In thisorientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the samedirection as external field, both normal to the  plane of the loop,thus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.(c)It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field tomaximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greaterarea than any other shape.4.9.2  Circular current loop as a magnetic dipoleIn this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: thecurrent loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour tothe electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.5, we have evaluatedthe magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying asteady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.11)],( )µ=+203/22 22I RBx Rand its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumbrule (Fig. 4.10). Here,  x is the distance along the axis from the centre ofthe loop. For  x >> R, we may drop the R2 term in the denominator. Thus,µ=2032IRBxNote that the area of the loop A = πR2. Thus,µ=π032IABxAs earlier, we define the magnetic moment m to have a magnitude IA,m  = I A. Hence,Bm≃µ032πx    πµ=0324xm[4.25(a)]The expression of Eq. [4.25(a)] is very similar to an expression obtainedearlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if wesubstitute, µ ε→0 01/2024-25"

(1.20)].It can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. Wehad found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisectorof the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],E≃pex403πεwhere x is the distance from the dipole. If we replace p à m and 0 01/µ ε→in the above expression, we obtain the result for B for a point in theplane of the loop at a distance x  from the centre. For  x >>R,Bm≃µ034πxx R ; >> [4.25(b)]The results given by Eqs. [4.25(a)] and [4.25(b)] become exact for apoint magnetic dipole.The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole momentm = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementaryunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magneticdipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalentof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (seeFig. 4 .10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggestthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partlytrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsicmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.4.10  THE  MOVING C OIL GALVANOMETERCurre nts and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively inChapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim thatcurrent in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?Figure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the movingcoil galvanometer  (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understoodon the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotateabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There isa cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but alsoincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows throughthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is giv en by Eq. (4.20) to beτ = NI AB2024-25Physics130where the symbols have their usual meaning. Sincethe field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ = 1 inthe above expression for the torque. The magnetictorque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring Spprovides a counter torque kφ that balances themagnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angulardeflection φ. In equilibriumkφ = NI ABwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. therestoring torque per unit twist. The deflection φ isindicated on the scale by a pointer attached to thespring. We haveφ=NABkI (4.26)The quantity in brackets is a constant for a givengalvanometer.The galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.It can be used as a detector to check if a current isflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usagein the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usagethe neutral position of the pointer (when no current isflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle ofthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.20.Depending on the direction of the current, the pointer’sdeflection is either to the right or the left.The galvanometer cannot as such be used as anammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is fortwo reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for a current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring currents,the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a largeresistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. Toovercome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shuntresistance , in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of thecurrent passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,RG rs / (RG  + rs)   ≃  rs         if    RG >>  rsIf rs has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of thecircuit Rc, the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also smalland negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21.The scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read offthe current value with ease. We define the current sensitivity of thegalvanometer as the deflection per unit current . From Eq. (4.26) thiscurrent sensitivity is,NABI kφ= (4.27)A convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity isto increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers havingsensitivities of value, required by our experiment.FIGURE  4.20  The moving coilgalvanometer. Its elements aredescribed in the text. Depending onthe requirement, this device can beused as a current detector or formeasuring the value of the current(ammeter) or voltage (voltmeter).FIGURE  4.21Conversion of agalvanometer (G) toan ammeter by theintroduction of ashunt resistance rs ofvery small value inparallel.2024-25"
55 Magnetic Properties of Materials,"131Moving Charges andMagnetismThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure thevoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connectedin parallel  with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a verysmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the originalset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep thedisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensurethis, a large resistance R is connected in series  with the galvanometer.This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that theresistance of the voltmeter is now,RG + R ≃ R :  largeThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage valuewith ease. We define the voltage sensitivity as the deflection per unitvoltage . From Eq. (4.26),φVNABkIVNABk R= =1(4.28)An interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivitymay not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.27)which provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N → 2N, i.e., we doublethe number of turns, then2I Iφ φ→Thus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of thegalvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the lengthof the wire. In Eq. (4.28), N →2N, and R →2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,V Vφ φ→remains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversionof a galvanometer to an ammeter  will be different from what is needed forconverting it into a voltmeter.Example 4.12  In the circuit (Fig. 4.23) the current is to bemeasured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown(a) is a galvanometer with a resistance RG = 60.00 Ω; (b) is agalvanometer described in (a) but converted to an ammeter by ashunt resistance rs = 0.02 Ω; (c) is an ideal ammeter with zeroresistance?FIGURE  4.23FIGURE  4.22Conversion of agalvanometer (G) to avoltmeter by theintroduction of aresistance R of largevalue in series.EXAMPLE  4.122024-25Physics132SUMMARY1.The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence ofmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentzforce .

Its frequency of uniform circular motion is calledthe cyclotron frequency  and is given by:2cq Bmν=πThis frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. Thisfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used toaccelerate charged particles.4.The Biot-Savart  law asserts that the magnetic field d B due to anelement d l carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r fromthe current element is:03dd4Irµ×=πl rBTo obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expressionover the entire length of the conductor.5.The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius Rcarrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre isEXAMPLE  4.12Solution(a)Total resistance in the circuit is,3 63GR+ = Ω .

Then the Ampere’s law states that B l.d I= ∫µ0C/integralloop where I refers tothe current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from theright-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If Bis directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of aclosed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,BL = µ0 Iewhere Ie is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.7.The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,straight wire carrying a current I is given by:π02IBRµ=The field lines are circles concentric with the wire.8.The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid  carrying a currentI isB = µ0nIwhere n is the number of turns per unit length.9.Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.10.A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, andan area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,m = N I Aand the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curlthe palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointingin the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives thedirection of m (and A)When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F onit is:  F = 0And the torque on it is,τ = m × BIn a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-torque due to a spring, yieldingkφ = NI ABwhere φ  is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant ofthe spring.11.A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter byintroducing a shunt resistance rs, of small value in parallel. It can beconverted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large valuein series.2024-25Physics134Physical Quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units RemarksPermeability of free µ0Scalar [MLT–2A–2] T m A–14π × 10–7 T m A–1spaceMagnetic Field B Vector [M T–2A–1] T (telsa)Magnetic Moment m Vector [L2A] A m2 or J/TTorsion Constant k   Scalar [M L2T–2]    N m rad–1Appears in MCGPOINTS TO PONDER1.Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at anegative charge or fade at infinity.

If one switches to a frame with instantaneousvelocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of thecharged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists anappropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss thedetails of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of thisparadox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena(electromagnetism ) and that the Lorentz force expression does not  implya universal preferred frame of reference in nature.4.Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. Itcan be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to theBiot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’ s law andCoulomb’s law.EXERCISES4.1 A circular coil of wire consisting of 100 turns, each of radius 8.0 cmcarries a current of 0.40 A.

Vast, distant galaxies, thetiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through andthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’smagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived fromthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia  where magnetic oredeposits were found, as early as 600 BC.In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electriccurrents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in theearly part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biotand Savart, among others.In the pr esent chapter , we take a look at magnetism as a subject in itsown right.Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:(i)The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointingapproximately from the geographic south to the north.(ii)When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-southdirection. The tip which points to the geographic north is called thenorth pole  and the tip which points to the geographic south is calledthe south pole  of the magnet.Chapter FiveMAGNETISM ANDMATTER2024-25137Magnetism andMatter(iii)There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of twomagnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractiveforce between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole ofthe other.(iv)We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnetis broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets withsomewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magneticnorth and south poles known as magnetic monopoles  do not exist.(v)It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in anexternal magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We nextdescribe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magneticproperties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism.5.2  T 5.2  T5.2  T 5.2  T5.2  T HE HEHE HEHE B  B B  B BAR ARAR ARAR M  M M  M MAGNET AGNETAGNET AGNETAGNETWe begin our study by examining ironfilings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placedover a short bar magnet. The arrangementof iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.1.     The pattern of iron filings suggeststhat the magnet has two poles similar tothe positive and negative charge of anelectric dipole. As mentioned in theintroductory section, one pole isdesignated the North pole  and the other,the South pole . When suspended freely,these poles point approximately towardsthe geographic north and south poles,respectively. A similar pattern of ironfilings is observed around a currentcarrying solenoid.5.2.1  The magnetic field lines5.2.1  The magnetic field lines5.2.1  The magnetic field lines5.2.1  The magnetic field lines5.2.1  The magnetic field linesThe pattern of iron filings permits us to plotthe magnetic field lines * ** **. This is shown bothfor the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in  Fig. 5. 2. Forcomparison refer to the Chapter 1, Fig ure 1.14(d). Electric field lines of anelectric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5. 2(c). The magnetic field lines are avisual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field . Their properties are:(i)The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuousclosed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field linesbegin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escapeto infinity.* ** **In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called magnetic lines of force .This nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostaticsthe field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a(moving) charge.FIGURE FIGUREFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE  5.1  5.1 5.1  5.1 5.1 The arrangementof iron filings surrounding a barmagnet.

61 Introduction,"Physics138(ii)The tangent to the field line at a givenpoint represents the direction of the netmagnetic field B at that point.(iii)The larger the number of field linescrossing per unit area, the stronger isthe magnitude of the magnetic field B.In Fig. 5.2(a), B is larger aroundregion  ii  than in region  i  .(iv)The magnetic field lines do notintersect, for if they did, the directionof the magnetic field would not beunique at the point of intersection.One can plot the magnetic field linesin a variety of ways. One way is to place asmall magnetic compass needle at variouspositions and note its orientation. Thisgives us an idea of the magnetic fielddirection at various points in space.5.2.2  Bar magnet as anequivalent solenoidIn the previous chapter, we haveexplained how a current loop acts as amagnetic dipole (Section 4.9). Wementioned Ampere’s hypothesis that allmagnetic phenomena can be explained interms of circulating currents.FIGURE  5.3 Calculation of (a) The axial field of afinite solenoid in order to demonstrate itssimilarity to that of a bar magnet.

62 The Experiments of Faraday and Henry,"139Magnetism andMatterThe resemblance of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet and a solenoidsuggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number ofcirculating currents in analogy with a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet inhalf is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weakermagnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging fromone face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test thisanalogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of abar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that thedeflections of the needle are similar in both cases.To make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of afinite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at largedistances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.The magnitude of the field at point P due to the solenoid is0324mBrµπ= (5.1)This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one mayobtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similarmagnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal tothe magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the samemagnetic field.5.2.3  The dipole in a uniform magnetic fieldLet’s place a small compass needle of known magnetic moment m allowingit to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown inFig. 5.3(b).The torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.23)],τ ττ ττ = m × B (5.2)In magnitude τ = mB sinθHere τ ττ ττ  is restoring torque and θ is the angle between m and B.An expression for magnetic potential energy can be obtained on linessimilar to  electrostatic potential energy.The magnetic potential energy Um is given byU dm=∫τ θ θ( )      = = − ∫mB d mBsin cos θ θ θ      = –m.B (5.3)We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energycan be fixed at one’s convenience. Taking the constant of integration to bezero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90°, i.e., when theneedle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potentialenergy is minimum (= – mB) at θ = 0° (most stable position) and maximum(= +mB) at θ = 180° (most unstable position).Example 5.1(a)What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (i) transverseto its length, (ii) along its length?(b)A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences atorque but no net force. An iron nail near a bar magnet, however,experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why? EXAMPLE  5.12024-25"
63 Magnetic Flux,"Physics140 EXAMPLE  5.1(c)Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a southpole? What about the field due to a toroid?(d)Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of whichis definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know whichone.) How would one ascertain whether or not both aremagnetised? If only one is magnetised, how does one ascertainwhich one?  [Use nothing else but the bars A and B.]Solution(a)In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north andsouth pole.(b)No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-uniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magneticmoment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force andtorque. The net force is attractive because the induced southpole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet thaninduced north pole.(c)Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a netnon-zero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even fora straight infinite conductor.(d)Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force insome situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it isalways attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a barmagnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at thetwo ends (poles) and weakest at the central region. This factmay be used to  determine whether A or B is the magnet. In thiscase, to see which one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one,(say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of theother (say, B), and then on the middle of B. If you notice that inthe middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised. Ifyou do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B,then A is magnetised.5.2.4  The electrostatic analogComparison of Eqs. (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) with the corresponding equationsfor electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic field at largedistances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment m can be obtainedfrom the equation for electric field due to an electric dipole of dipole momentp, by making the following replacements:→E B , →p m , 0014 4µε→π πIn particular, we can write down the equatorial field ( BE) of a bar magnetat a distance r, for r  >> l, where  l is the size of the magnet:034Erµ= −πmB (5.4)Likewise, the axial field ( BA) of a bar magnet for r >> l is:0324Arµ=πmB (5.5)2024-25"

(5. 4) and (5. 5)]:0 PP 34rµπ= −mB      (on the normal bisector)0 PP 324rµπ=mB      (on the axis)where mP is the magnetic moment of the dipole P.Equilibrium is stable when mQ is parallel to BP, and unstable when itis anti-parallel to BP.2024-25Physics142KARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS  (1777 – 1855)Karl Friedrich Gauss(1777 – 1855)  He was achild prodigy and was giftedin mathematics, physics,engineering, astronomyand even land surveying.The properties of numbersfascinated him, and in hiswork he anticipated majormathematical developmentof later times. Along withWilhelm Welser, he built thefirst electric telegraph in1833. His mathematicaltheory of curved surfacelaid the foundation for thelater work of Riemann.For instance for the configuration Q3 for which Q is along theperpendicular bisector of the dipole P, the magnetic moment of Q isparallel to the magnetic field at the position 3. Hence Q3 is stable.Thus,(a)PQ1 and PQ2(b)(i) PQ3, PQ6 (stable); (ii) PQ5, PQ4 (unstable)(c)PQ65.3  M AGNETISM  AND GAUSS’S LAWIn Chapter 1, we studied Gauss’s law for electrostatics.In Fig 5.2(c), we see that for a closed surface representedby  i , the number of lines leaving the surface is equal tothe number of lines entering it. This is consistent with thefact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However,in the same figure, for the closed surfac e ii , there  is a netoutward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.The situation is radically different for magnetic fieldswhich are continuous and form closed loops. Examine theGaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5. 2(a) orFig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that thenumber of magnetic field lines leaving the surface isbalanced by the number of lines entering it. The netmagnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces . This is truefor any closed surface.FIGURE  5.5Consider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed surface S as inFig. 5.5. The magnetic flux through ÄS is defined as ∆φB = B.∆S, where Bis the field  at ∆S. We divide S into many small area elements and calculatethe individual flux through each. Then, the net flux φB is,φ φB Ball all= = =∑ ∑Δ Δ’ ’ ’ ’B S. 0 (5.6)where ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements ∆S′. Compare this with the Gauss’slaw of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface in that case isgiven byE S.Δ =∑qε0 EXAMPLE  5.22024-25143Magnetism andMatterwhere q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.The difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that forelectrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (alsocalled monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinksof B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. Allmagnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement ofdipoles and/or current loops.Thus, Gauss’s law for magnetism is:The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero .Example 5.3   Many of the diagrams given in Fig. 5.6 show magneticfield lines (thick lines in the figure) wrongly . Point out what is wrongwith them. Some of them may describe electrostatic field lines correctly.Point out which ones.FIGURE 5.6 EXAMPLE  5.32024-25"
65 Lenz’s Law and Conservation of Energy,"Physics144 EXAMPLE  5.4  EXAMPLE  5.3Solution(a)Wrong . Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, asshown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B mustalways be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem toenter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field linesshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively chargedwire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straightconductor, as described in Chapter 4.(b)Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never crosseach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point ofintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around emptyspace. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose aregion across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostaticfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,nor when the loop encloses charges.(c)Right . Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since eachloop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, forclarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have beenshown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windingscontains magnetic field.(d)Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannotbe so completely straight and confined; such a thing violatesAmpere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meeteventually to form closed loops.(e)Right . These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Notecarefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanateout of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around boththe N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.(f)Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out ofthe shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding theshaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field.The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field linesaround a positively charged upper plate and a negatively chargedlower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.6(e) and ( f)]  should becarefully grasped.(g)Wrong . Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot beprecisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable.Otherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electricfield lines.Example  5.4(a)Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along whicha small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magneticfield lines also represent the lines of force  on a moving chargedparticle at every point?(b)If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law ofmagnetism be modified?(c)Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field?Does one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on anotherelement of the same wire ?2024-25145Magnetism andMatter EXAMPLE  5.4(d)Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a systemhave magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?Solution(a)No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magneticforce = qv × B). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as linesof force .(b)Gauss’s law of magnetism states that the flux of B through anyclosed surface is always zero B s.Δ =∫0s.If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to themonopole (magnetic charge) qm enclosed by S. [Analogous toGauss’s law of electrostatics, B s.Δ =∫µ0qmS where qm is the(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S.](c) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the fieldproduced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque)on an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straightwire, this force is zero.)(d)Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet,the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loopsmay not be zero. We will come across such examples in connectionwith paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole momentthrough their net charge is zero.5.4  M AGNETISATION  AND MAGNETIC  INTENSITYThe earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds.In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and evenelements. One would like to classify the magnetic properties of thesesubstances. In the present section, we define and explain certain termswhich will help us to carry out this exercise.We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magneticmoment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and theycan give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We definemagnetisation  M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment perunit volume:netV=mM (5.7)M is a vector with dimensions L–1 A and is measured in a units of A m–1.Consider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying acurrent I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown tobe given byB0 = µ0 nI (5.8)If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zeromagnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B0. Thenet B field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed asB = B0 + Bm(5.9)2024-25"
66 Motional Electromotive Force,"Physics146 EXAMPLE  5.5where Bm is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out thatthis additional field Bm is proportional to the magnetisation M of thematerial and is expressed asBm = µ0M (5.10)where µ0 is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears inBiot-Savart’s law.It is convenient to introduce another vector field H, called the magneticintensity , which is defined by0–µ=BH M (5.11)where H has the same dimensions as M and is measured in units of A m–1.Thus, the total magnetic field B is written asB = µ0 (H + M) (5.12)We repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contributionto the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due toexternal factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is representedby H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,namely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. Thisinfluence is mathematically expressed asχ=M H (5.13)where χ, a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magneticsusceptibility . It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to anexternal field. χ is small and positive for materials, which are calledparamagnetic. It is small and negative for materials, which are termeddiamagnetic . In the latter case  M and H are opposite in direction. FromEqs. (5.12) and (5.13) we obtain,0(1 )µ χ= +B H (5.14)= µ0 µr H=  µ H (5.15)where µr= 1 +  χ, is a dimensionless quantity called the relative magneticpermeability  of the substance. It is the analog of the dielectric constant inelectrostatics. The magnetic per meability  of the substance is µ and it hasthe same dimensions and units as µ0;µ = µ0µr = µ0 (1+χ).The three quantities χ, µr and µ are interrelated and only one ofthem is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.Example 5.5 A solenoid has a core of a material with relativepermeability 400. The windings of the solenoid are insulated from thecore and carry a current of 2A. If the number of turns is 1000 permetre, calculate (a) H, (b) M , (c) B  and (d) the magnetising current Im.2024-25147Magnetism andMatter EXAMPLE  5.5Solution(a)The field H is dependent of the material of the core, and isH = nI = 1000  × 2.0 = 2  ×103 A/m.(b)The magnetic field B is given byB = µr µ0 H   = 400  × 4π ×10–7 (N/A2) × 2 × 103 (A/m)   = 1.0 T(c)Magnetisation is given byM = (B– µ0 H)/ µ0    = ( µr µ0 H–µ0 H)/µ0 = (µr – 1)H = 399  × H     ≅ 8  × 105 A/m(d)The magnetising current IM is the additional current that needsto be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absenceof the core which would give a B value as in the presence of thecore. Thus B = µr n (I + IM). Using I = 2A, B = 1 T, we get IM = 794 A.5.5 M AGNETIC  PROPERTIES OF MATERIALSThe discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials asdiamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibilityχ, a material is diamagnetic if χ is negative, para- if χ is positive and small,and ferro- if χ is large and positive.A glance at Table 5.2 gives one a better feeling for these materials.Here ε is a small positive number introduced to quantify paramagneticmaterials. Next, we describe these materials in some detail.TABLE 5.2Diamagnetic Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic–1 ≤ χ < 0 0 < χ <  ε χ >> 10 ≤ µr < 1 1< µr < 1+ ε µr >> 1µ < µ0µ > µ0µ >> µ05.5.1  DiamagnetismDiamagnetic substances are those which have tendency to move fromstronger to the weaker part of the external magnetic field. In other words,unlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel adiamagnetic substance.Figure 5. 7(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an externalmagnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field insidethe material is reduced. In most cases, this reduction is slight, being onepart in 105. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tendto move from high to low field.FIGURE  5.7Behaviour ofmagnetic field linesnear a(a) diamagnetic,(b) paramagneticsubstance.2024-25Physics148The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons inan atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thuspossess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the onesin which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magneticfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in thesame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.This happen s due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law whichyou will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magneticmoment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon,nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is presentin all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that itgets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.The most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors . Theseare metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfectconductivity  and perfect diamagnetism . Here the field lines are completelyexpelled!  χ = –1 and µr = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (byNewton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfectdiamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect , after thename of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfullyexploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magneticallylevitated superfast trains.5.5.2  ParamagnetismParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised whenplaced in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from aregion of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weaklyattracted to a magnet.The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic materialpossess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On accountof the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisationis seen. In the presence of an external field B0, which is strong enough,and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can bemade to align and point in the same direction as B0. Figure 5.7(b) showsa bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field linesgets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. Inmost cases, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 105. When placedin a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak fieldto strong.Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium,oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both χand µr depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) onthe sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature islowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation valueat which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.2024-25"
67 Inductance,"149Magnetism andMatter5.5.3  FerromagnetismFerromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised whenplaced in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to movefrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they getstrongly attracted to a magnet.The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic materialpossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, theyinteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously alignthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume calleddomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantummechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has anet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain containsabout 1011 atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomlyfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shownin Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B0, the domainsorient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domainoriented in the direction of B0 grow in size. This existence of domains andtheir motion in B0 are not speculations. One may observe this under amicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powderedferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can beobserved. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the domains have alignedand amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain. Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highlyconcentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to movetowards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happenswhen the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials themagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materialsor hard ferromagnets . Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobaltand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone isanother. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among otherthings as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class offerromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removalof the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough,such materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials . There are a numberof elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium,etc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enoughtemperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structuredisintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation withtemperature is gradual.FIGURE  5.8(a) Randomlyoriented domains,(b) Aligned domains.SUMMARY1.The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient timesthat magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like2024-25Physics150magnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnetin two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.2.When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magneticfield B,     (a) the force on it is zero,     (b) the torque on it is m × B,     (c) its potential energy is –m.B, where we choose the zero of energy atthe orientation when m is perpendicular to B.3.Consider a bar magnet of size l and magnetic moment m, at a distancer from its mid-point, where r >>l, the magnetic field B due to this baris,032rµ=πmB    (along axis)   =03–4rµπm    (along equator)4.Gauss’s law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux throughany closed surface is zero0   SB SiBall areaelements5.Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field B0. Themagnetic intensity is defined as,00µ=BHThe magnetisation M of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume.The magnetic field B in the material is,      B = µ0 (H + M )6.For a linear material M = χ H. So that B = µ H and χ is called themagnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, χ, therelative magnetic permeability µr, and the magnetic permeability µ  arerelated as follows:µ = µ0 µr      µr = 1+ χ7.Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic,and ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ is negative and smalland for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagneticmaterials have large χ and are characterised by non-linear relationbetween B and H.8.Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagneticproperty for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.2024-25151Magnetism andMatterPOINTS TO PONDER1.A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of movingcharges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technologicalexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientificunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding isnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, scienceand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other intandem.2.Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you gettwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negativecharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, theelectronic charge with value | e| = 1.6 ×10–19 C. All other charges areintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge isquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or whyelectric charge is quantised.3.A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is thatthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminateon the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).4.A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yieldsradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. Fordiamagnetic materials  χ = –10–5 whereas χ = +10–5 for paramagneticmaterials.Physical quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units RemarksPermeability of µ0Scalar [MLT–2 A–2] T m A–1µ0/4π = 10–7free spaceMagnetic field, B Vector [MT–2 A–1] T (tesla) 104 G (gauss) = 1 TMagnetic induction,Magnetic flux densityMagnetic moment m Vector [L–2 A] A m2Magnetic flux φBScalar [ML2T–2 A–1] W (weber) W = T m2Magnetisation M Vector [L–1 A] A m–1 Magnetic momentVolumeMagnetic intensity H Vector [L–1 A] A m–1B = µ0 (H + M )Magnetic fieldstrengthMagnetic χ Scalar - - M = χHsusceptibilityRelative magnetic µrScalar - - B = µ0 µr HpermeabilityMagnetic permeability µ Scalar [MLT–2 A–2] T m A–1µ = µ0 µrN A–2B = µ H2024-25Physics1525.There exists a perfect diamagnet , namely, a superconductor. This is ametal at very low temperatures. In this case χ = –1, µr = 0, µ = 0. Theexternal magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material isalso a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory whichties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory byBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. TheBCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a NobelPrize in physics in 1970.6.Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But itis weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.7.We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, andferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic materialsuch as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with propertieswhich are exotic and mysterious.EXERCISES5.1 A short bar magnet placed with its axis at 30° with a uniform externalmagnetic field of 0.25 T experiences a torque of magnitude equal to4.5 × 10–2 J.

68 AC Generator,"Physics1546.1  I NTRODUCTIONElectricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelatedphenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few othersestablished the fact that electricity and magnetism ar e inter -related. Theyfound that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permitsuch a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer isresounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England andJoseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstratedconclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils whensubjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter , we will study thephenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understandthe underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current isgenerated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately calledelectromagnetic induction .When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motionbetween a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in thelatter , he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His r eply was: “What is theuse of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic inductionChapter SixELECTROMAGNETICINDUCTION2024-25ElectromagneticInduction155is not merely of theoretical or academic interest but alsoof practical utility. Imagine a world where there is noelectricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones andno personal computers. The pioneering experiments ofFaraday and Henry have led directly to the developmentof modern day generators and transformers. Today’scivilisation owes its progress to a great extent to thediscovery of electromagnetic induction.6.2THE EXPERIMENTS  OF FARADA Y ANDHENRYThe discovery and understanding of electromagneticinduction are based on a long series of experiments carriedout by Faraday and Henry. W e shall now describe someof these experiments.Experiment 6.1Figure 6.1 shows a coil C1* connected to a galvanometerG. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushedtowards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects,indicating  the presence of electric  current in the coil. Thedeflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.The galvanometer does not show any deflection when themagnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulledaway from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection inthe opposite direction, which indicates reversal of thecurrent’s dir ection. Mor eover , when the South-pole ofthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from thecoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are oppositeto that observed with the North-pole for similarmovements. Further , the deflection (and hence curr ent)is found to be larger when the magnet is pushedtowar ds or pulled away fr om the coil faster . Instead,when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 ismoved towards or away from the magnet, the sameeffects are observed. It shows that it is the relativemotion between the magnet and the coil that isresponsible for generation (induction) of electriccurrent in the coil .Experiment 6.2In Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coilC2 connected to a battery. The steady current in thecoil C2 produces a steady magnetic field. As coil C2 is*Wherever the term ‘coil’ or ‘loop’ is used, it is assumed that they are made up ofconducting material and are prepared using wires which are coated with insulatingmaterial.FIGURE  6.1 When the bar magnet ispushed towards the coil, the pointer inthe galvanometer G deflects.Josheph Henry [1797 –1878]  American experimentalphysicist, professor atPrinceton University and firstdirector of the SmithsonianInstitution. He made importantimprovements in electro-magnets by winding coils ofinsulated wire around ironpole pieces and  invented anelectromagnetic motor and anew, efficient telegraph. Hediscoverd self-induction andinvestigated how currents inone circuit induce currents inanother .JOSEPH HENRY (1797 – 1878)2024-25Physics156moved towards the coil C1, the galvanometer shows adeflection. This indicates that electric current is induced incoil C1. When C2 is moved away, the galvanometer shows adeflection again, but this time in the opposite direction. Thedeflection lasts as long as coil C2 is in motion. When the coilC2 is held fixed and C1 is moved, the same effects are observed.Again, it is the relative motion between the coils that inducesthe electric current .Experiment 6.3The above two experiments involved relative motion betweena magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.Through another experiment, Faraday showed that thisrelative motion is not an absolute requirement. Figure 6.3shows two coils C1 and C2 held stationary. Coil C1 is connectedto galvanometer G while the second coil C2 is connected to abattery through a tapping key K.FIGURE  6.2  Current isinduced in coil C1 due to motionof the current carrying coil C2.FIGURE  6.3 Experimental set-up for Experiment 6.3.It is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflectionwhen the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returnsto zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is nodeflection in the galvanometer . When the key is r eleased, a momentorydeflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observedthat the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is insertedinto the coils along their axis.6.3  M AGNETIC  FLUXFaraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relationto explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagneticinduction. However , befor e we state and appr eciate his laws, we must getfamiliar with the notion of magnetic flux, F B. Magnetic flux is defined inthe same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1. Magnetic flux through2024-25ElectromagneticInduction157a plane of area A placed in a uniform magnetic field B (Fig. 6.4) canbe written asF B  = B . A = BA cos q (6.1)where q   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vectorhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can beextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions atvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magneticflux through the surface is given by1 1 2 2d d Φ= + +B A B A. .B... = B A.i idall∑(6.2)where ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dAicomprising the surface and Bi is the magnetic field at the area elementdAi. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla metersquared (T m2). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.6.4  F ARADA Y’S LAW OF INDUCTIONFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at aconclusion that an emf  is induced in a coil when magnetic fluxthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observationsdiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C1 inExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towardsor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magneticflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux inducesemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electriccurrent to flow in coil C1 and thr ough the galvanometer . Aplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 isas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current incoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to amaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magneticflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change inmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.When the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,there is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current incoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and theresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in ashort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C1and hence again induces an electric current in coil C1*. The commonpoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magneticflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimentalobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagneticinduction . The law is stated below.FIGURE  6.4 A plane ofsurface area A placed in auniform magnetic field B.FIGURE  6.5 Magnetic field Biat the ith area element. d Airepresents area vector of theith area element.*Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnetcan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when theelectromagnet is turned on or off.2024-25Physics158 EXAMPLE  6.1The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equalto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through thecircuit.Mathematically, the induced emf  is given byd–dBtΦε= (6.3)The negative sign indicates the direction of e  and hencethe direction of current in a closed loop. This will bediscussed in detail in the next section.In the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, changeof flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,the expression for the total induced emf is given byd–dBNtΦε= (6.4)The induced emf can be increased by increasing thenumber of turns N of a closed coil.From Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can bevaried by changing any one or more of the terms B, A andq. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux ischanged by varying B. The flux can also be altered bychanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it orstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in amagnetic field such that the angle q  between B and Achanges. In these cases too, an emf is induced in therespective coils.Example 6.1  Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtaina large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstratethe presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?Solution(a)To obtain a large deflection , one or more of the following steps canbe taken:  (i) Use a rod made of soft iron  inside the coil C2, (ii) Connectthe coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) M ove the arrangement rapidlytowards the test coil  C1.(b)Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in asmall torch  light. The relative motion between the two coils will causethe bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an inducedcurrent.In experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faradaywho is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever , was legendaryfor his innovative skills.Example 6.2A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 W isplaced vertically in the east-west  plane. A uniform magnetic field of0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. Themagnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determinethe magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.Michael Faraday  [1791–1867] Faraday madenumerous contributions toscience, viz., the discoveryof electromagneticinduction, the laws ofelectrolysis, benzene, andthe fact that the plane ofpolarisation is rotated in anelectric field. He is alsocredited with the inventionof the electric motor , theelectric generator and thetransfor mer. He is widelyregarded as the greatestexperimental scientist ofthe nineteenth century.MICHAEL FARADA Y (1791–1867) EXAMPLE  6.22024-25ElectromagneticInduction159 EXAMPLE  6.2Solution The angle q made by the area vector of the coil with themagnetic field is 45°. From Eq. (6.1), the initial magnetic flux isF = BA cos q–20.1 10Wb2×=Final flux, Fmin = 0The change in flux is brought about in 0.70 s. From Eq.

But it is a steady field (which does not change within the timespan of the experiment) and hence does not induce any emf.Example 6.3A circular coil of radius 10 cm, 500 turns and resistance 2 W is placedwith its plane perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’smagnetic field. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°in 0.25 s. Estimate the magnitudes of the emf and current induced inthe coil. Horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at theplace is 3.0 × 10–5 T.SolutionInitial flux through the coil,FB (initial)= BA cos q= 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 0°= 3p × 10–7 WbFinal flux after the rotation,FB (final)    = 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 180°= –3p  × 10–7 WbTherefore, estimated value of the induced emf is,NtΦεΔ=Δ   = 500 × (6 p × 10–7)/0.25   = 3.8  × 10–3  VI = e/R = 1.9 × 10–3 ANote that the magnitudes of e and I are the estimated values. Theirinstantaneous values are different and depend upon the speed ofrotation at the particular instant. EXAMPLE  6.32024-25Physics1606.5  L ENZ’ S LAW AND C ONSER VATION OF ENERGYIn 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduceda rule, known as Lenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emfin a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:The polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a currentwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) repr esents this ef fect. W e canunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. InFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushedtowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towardsthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current isinduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter -clockwisedirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polaritytowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic fluxthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result inan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and thecorresponding decrease in flux.What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loopin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the openends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be foundusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easierway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that thedirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the inducedcurrents.A little reflection on this matter should convince us on thecorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was inthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approachingNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attractedtowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push onthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energywill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this canhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by asuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energyand hence can not happen.Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the inducedcurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy isdissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.FIGURE  6.6Illustration ofLenz’s law.2024-25"

Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductorPQRS  in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is movedtowards the left with a constant velocity v  asshown in the figure. Assume that there is noloss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms aclosed circuit enclosing an area that changesas PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magneticfield B which is perpendicular to the plane ofthis system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, themagnetic flux FB enclosed  by the loop PQRSwill beFB = BlxSince x is changing with time, the rate of changeof flux FB will induce an emf given by:( )– d d–d dBBlxt tΦε= =   = d–dxBl Blvt= (6.5)FIGURE  6.10  The arm PQ is moved to the leftside, thus decreasing the area of therectangular loop. This movementinduces a current I as shown.2024-25ElectromagneticInduction163where we have used dx /dt = –v  which is the speed of the conductor PQ.The induced emf Blv is called motional emf . Thus, we are able to produceinduced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductorPQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rodmoves with speed v , the charge will also be moving with speed v in themagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, inmagnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,W = qvBlSince emf is the work done per unit charge,Wqε=    = BlvThis equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identicalto Eq. (6.5). W e stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. Butit does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law whenthe conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independentmagnetic field.On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when aconductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact whichFaraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationaryconductor , the for ce on its char ges is given byF = q (E + v ´ ´´ ´´ B) = qE (6.6)since v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electricfield term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf orinduced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic fieldgenerates an electric field. However , we hasten to add that electric fieldsproduced by static electric charges have properties different from thoseproduced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt thatcharges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changingmagnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is thefundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity andmagnetism are related.Example 6.6  A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated  with a frequencyof 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the cent re and the other end at thecircumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1  m, about an axispassing through the cent re and perpendicular to the plane of the ring(Fig. 6.11) . A constant and uniform magnetic field  of 1 T parallel to theaxis is present everywhere. What is the emf  between the cent re andthe metallic ring? EXAMPLE  6.62024-25Physics164 EXAMPLE  6.6FIGURE  6.11SolutionMethod IAs the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outerend due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, theresulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends ofthe rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electronsand a steady state is reached. Using Eq.

Thesetwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.However, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to thecurrent. That is,  ΦB α I.Further, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,d dd dB It tΦ∝For a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linkedwith all the turns. When the flux ΦB through the coil changes, each turncontributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage  isused which is equal to NΦB for a closely wound coil and in such a caseNΦB∝ IThe constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance .We shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coiland intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance whichfor a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium(intrinsic material property).Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T–2 A–2]given by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. TheSI unit of inductance is henry  and is denoted by H. It is named in honourof Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,independently of Faraday in England.6.7.1  Mutual inductanceConsider Fig. 6.12 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of lengthl. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number ofturns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outersolenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total numberof turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively.2024-25Physics166When a current I2 is set up through S2, it in turn setsup a magnetic flux through S1. Let us denote it by Φ1.The corresponding flux linkage with  solenoid S1 isN11 12 2M IΦ= (6.7)M12 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S1 withrespect to solenoid S2. It is also referred to as thecoefficient of mutual induction .For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible tocalculate M12. The magnetic field due to the current I2 inS2 is µ0n2I2. The resulting flux linkage with coil S1 is,()()()21 1 1 1 0 2 2N n l r n IΦ µ = π         20 1 2 1 2n n r l Iµ= π (6.8)where n1l is the total number of turns in solenoid S1.Thus, from Eq. (6.7) and Eq. (6.8),M12 = µ0n1n2πr21l (6.9)Note that we neglected the edge effects and consideredthe magnetic field µ0n2I2 to be uniform throughout thelength and width of the solenoid S2. This is a good approximation keepingin mind that the solenoid is long, implying l  >> r2.We now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is passed through thesolenoid S1 and the flux linkage with coil S2 is,N2Φ2 = M21 I1(6.10)M21 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S2 with respect tosolenoid S1.The flux due to the current I1 in S1 can be assumed to be confinedsolely inside S1 since the solenoids are very long. Thus, flux linkage withsolenoid S2 is()()()22 2 2 1 0 1 1N n l r n IΦ µ = πwhere n2l is the total number of turns of S2. From Eq. (6.10),M21 = µ0n1n2πr21l (6.11)Using Eq. (6.9) and Eq. (6.10), we getM12 = M21= M (say) (6.12)We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoidwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, thenwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N1Φ1 because the innersolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to theouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However,it would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outersolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary acrossthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, thecalculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case. Theequality M12=M21 is very useful in such situations.FIGURE  6.12 Two long co-axialsolenoids of samelength l.2024-25ElectromagneticInduction167 EXAMPLE  6.8We explained the above example with air as the medium within thesolenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µr had been present,the mutual inductance would beM =µr µ0 n1n2π r21 lIt is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair ofcoils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relativeorientation.Example  6.8 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r1 andthe other of large radius r2, such that r1 << r2,  are placed co-axiallywith centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of thearrangement.Solution  Let a current I2 flow through the outer circular coil. Thefield at the centre of the coil is B2 = µ0I2 / 2r2. Since the otherco-axially placed coil has a very small radius, B2 may be consideredconstant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,Φ1 = πr21B2     20 1222rIrµπ=     = M12 I2Thus,20 11222rMrµπ=From Eq.

However, wecan accept this value because r1 << r2.Now, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment,emf is induced in coil C1 wherever there was any change in current throughcoil C2. Let Φ1 be the flux through coil C1 (say of N1 turns) when current incoil C2 is I2.Then, from Eq. (6.7), we haveN1Φ1 = MI2For currents varrying with time,()() 1 1 2 d dd dN MIt tΦ=Since induced emf in coil C1 is given by()1 1d–dNtΦε1=We get,2d–dIMtε1=2024-25"
75 AC V oltage Applied to a Capacitor,"Physics168It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouringcoil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of changeof current and mutual inductance of the two coils.6.7.2  Self-inductanceIn the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid dueto the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in asingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means ofvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is calledself-induction . In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns isproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed asBN IΦ∝BL N IΦ= (6.13)where constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance  of the coil. Itis also called the coefficient of self-induction  of the coil. When the currentis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is inducedin the coil. Using Eq. (6.13), the induced emf is given by()B d–dNtΦε=d–dILtε= (6.14)Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase ordecrease) of current in the coil.It is possible to calculate the  self-inductance for circuits with simplegeometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-sectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magneticfield due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ0 n I  (neglecting edgeeffects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is()()()0 BN nl n I AΦ µ=I Al n20µ=where nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,LIΒΝΦ=   20n Alµ= (6.15)If we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeabilityµr (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permeability),then,20r L n Alµ µ= (6.16)The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on thepermeability of the medium.The self-induced emf is also called the back em f as it opposes anychange in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays2024-25ElectromagneticInduction169the role of inertia . It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics.So, work needs to be done against the back emf ( ε) in establishing thecurrent. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For thecurrent I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done isddWItε=If we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,then using Eq.

The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxeswhich exist independently.

Themodern ac generator with a typical outputcapacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.In this section, we shall describe the basicprinciples behind this machine. The Y ugoslavinventor Nicola Tesla is credited with thedevelopment of the machine. As was pointed outin Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf orcurrent in a loop is through a change in theloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B , theeffective area of the loop (the face perpendicularto the field) is A cos q, where q is the anglebetween A and B. This method of producing aflux change is the principle of operation of a2024-25ElectromagneticInduction171simple ac generator . An ac generator converts mechanical ener gy intoelectrical energy.The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consistsof a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil isperpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (calledarmature) is mechanically rotated in the  uniform magnetic field by someexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux throughit to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of thecoil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip ringsand brushes.When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed w, the angle qbetween the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at anyinstant t  is q  = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective areaof the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and fromEq. (6.1), the flux at any time t  isFB = BA cos q = BA  cos wtFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N  turnsis then,d d– – (cos )dt dBN NBA ttΦε ω = =Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf isε ω ω=NBA sin t (6.19)where NBA w is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs whensin wt = ±1. If we denote NBA w as e0, thene = e0 sin wt (6.20)Since the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, orpolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emfhas its extremum value when q = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux isgreatest at these points.The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the currentis called alternating curr ent (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.2 0) can be written ase = e0sin 2p n t (6.21)where n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.Note that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emfand e varies between + e0 and – e0 periodically. W e shall lear n how todetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and currentin the next chapter .In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required forrotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, forexample, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators .Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or othersources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of thearmatur e. These ar e called thermal generators . Instead of coal, if anuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators .

In most generators, the coils are heldstationary and it is the electromagnets which are rotated. The frequencyof rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries such as USA, it is60 Hz.2024-25ElectromagneticInduction173SUMMARY1.The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magneticfield B is defined as,FB = B.A = BA cos qwhere q is the angle between B and A.2.Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of Nturns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,BddNtΦε= −Here FB is the flux linked with one turn of the coil.  If the circuit isclosed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of thecircuit.3.Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that ittends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic fluxthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s lawindicates this fact.4.When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magneticfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, theinduced emf (called motional em f) across its ends ise = Bl v5.Inductance is the ratio  of the flux -linkage  to current. It is equal to  NF/I.6.A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil(coil 1). This relation is given by,21 12ddIMtε= −The quantity M12 is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect tocoil 2. One can similarly define M21. There exists a general equality,M12 = M217.When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the samecoil. The self-induced emf is given by,ddILtε= −L is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of thecoil against the change of current through it.8.The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of amagnetic material of relative per meability mr, is given byL = mr  m0 n2 Alwhere A is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, l its length and nthe number of turns per unit length.9.In an ac generator , mechanical ener gy is converted to electrical ener gyby virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A  isrotated at n revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, thenthe motional emf produced ise = NBA (2pn) sin (2pnt)where we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular tothe field.2024-25"
77 Power in AC Circuit The Power Factor,"Physics174POINTS TO PONDER1.Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of thenineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and othersestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.Somewhat later , around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henrydemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.2.In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose thechanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.However , in case of an open cir cuit, an emf is induced acr oss its ends.How is it related to the flux change?3.The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independentlyfrom Faraday’s law using the Lor entz for ce on moving char ges. However ,even if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentzforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of atime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and staticcharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday’slaw. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle ofrelativity for Faraday’s law.EXERCISES6.1 Predict the direction of induced current in the situations describedby the following Figs. 6.15(a) to (f).Quantity Symbol Units Dimensions EquationsMagnetic Flux FBWb (weber) [M L2 T–2 A–1] FB = B AiEMF e V (volt) [M L2 T–3 A–1] e = B d( )/dN tΦ−Mutual Inductance M H (henry) [M L2 T–2 A–2] e1 ()12 2d /dM I t= −Self Inductance L H (henry) [M L2 T–2 A–2] () d /dL I tε= −2024-25ElectromagneticInduction175FIGURE  6.156.2 Use Lenz’s law to determine the direction of induced current in thesituations described by Fig. 6.16:(a)A wire of irregular shape turning into a circular shape;2024-25Physics176(b)A circular loop being deformed into a narrow straight wire.FIGURE  6.166.3 A long solenoid with 15 turns per cm has a small loop of area 2.0 cm2placed inside the solenoid normal to its axis.

These currents do not change direction with time. But voltagesand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mainssupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine functionwith time. Such a voltage is called alter nating voltage  (ac voltage) andthe curr ent driven by it in a circuit is called the alter nating curr ent (accurrent) *. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by powercompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The mainreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltagescan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other bymeans of transfor mers. Further , electrical ener gy can also be transmittedeconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics whichare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever wetune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a specialproperty of ac cir cuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter .Chapter SevenALTERNATINGCURRENT*The phrases ac voltage  and ac current  are contradictory and redundant,respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage  and alternatingcurrent current . Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantitydisplaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally acceptedthat we follow others in its use. Further , voltage  – another phrase commonlyused means potential difference between two points.2024-25"

He conceived theidea of the rotatingmagnetic field, which is thebasis of practically allalternating currentmachinery, and whichhelped usher in the age ofelectric power. He alsoinvented among otherthings the induction motor,the polyphase system of acpower, and the highfrequency induction coil(the Tesla coil) used in radioand television sets andother electronic equipment.The SI unit of magnetic fieldis named in his honour.7.2  AC V OLTAGE  APPLIED TO A RESISTORFigure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε ofac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuitdiagram is . We consider a source which producessinusoidally varying potential difference across itsterminals. Let this potential difference, also called acvoltage, be given bysinmv v t ω = (7.1)where vm is the amplitude of the oscillating potentialdifference and ω  is its angular frequency.To find the value of current through the resistor, weapply Kirchhoff’s loop rule ε( )t=∑ 0(refer to Section3.12), to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to get= sinmv t i Rωor   sinmvi tRω =Since R  is a constant, we can write this equation assinmi i t ω= (7.2)where the current amplitude im is given bymmviR= (7.3)Equation (7.3) is Ohm’s law, which for resistors, works equallywell for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a pure resistorand the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) areplotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in particular thatboth v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum values at thesame time. Clearly, the voltage  and current are in phase witheach other .We see that, like the applied voltage, the current variessinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative valuesduring each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous currentvalues over one complete cycle is zero, and the average currentis zero.

As youknow, Joule heating is given by i2R and depends on i2(which is always positive whether i is positive or negative)and not on i.

This shows the advantage ofintroducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equationfor power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuitsare essentially the same as those for the dc case.It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. Forexample, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peakvoltage ofvm = 2 V =  (1.414)(220 V) = 311 VIn fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that wouldproduce the same average power loss as the alternating current.

But this is not so in the case  of an inductor ,a capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to showphase relationship between voltage and currentin an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors .The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by theuse of a phasor diagram. A phasor * is a vectorwhich rotates about the origin with angularspeed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The verticalcomponents of phasors V and I represent thesinusoidally varying quantities v and i. Themagnitudes of phasors V and I represent  theamplitudes or the peak values vm and im of theseoscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows thevoltage and current phasors and theirrelationship at time t1 for the case of an ac sourceconnected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to thecircuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection ofvoltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vm sinw t and im sinw t,respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. Asthey rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I  for the case of a resistor arein the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phaseangle between the voltage and the current is zero.7.4  AC V OLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTORFigur e 7.5 shows an ac sour ce connected to an inductor . Usually,inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shallassume that this inductor has negligible resistance.Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit.

They are scalar quantities. It so happensthat the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combinemathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors ofcorresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors  that representharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with asimple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.2024-25Physics182the inductor .

To obtain the current, we integrate d i/dt with respect totime:ddd dittvLt tm∫ ∫= sin( )ωand get,cos( ) constantmvi tL= − ω +ωThe integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetricallyabout zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically aboutzero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the currentexists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.Using− = − cos( ) sin ω ωt tπ2, we havei i tm= − sin ωπ2(7.12)where  mmviL=ωis the amplitude of the current. The quantity w L isanalogous to the resistance and is called inductive reactance , denotedby XL:XL = w L (7.13)The amplitude of the current is, thenmmLviX= (7.14)The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistanceand its SI unit is ohm ( W). The inductive reactance limits the current in apurely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits thecurrent in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directlyproportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and thecurrent in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by p/2 orone-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the currentphasors in the present case at instant t1. The current phasor I is p/2behind the voltage phasor V. When r otated with fr equency w counter -clockwise, they generate the voltage and current given by Eqs.

As char geaccumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltageacross them increases, opposing the current. That is,a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose thecurrent as it charges. When the capacitor is fullycharged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,as in Fig. 7.7, it limits or regulates the current, butdoes not completely prevent the flow of charge. Thecapacitor is alternately charged and discharged asthe current reverses each half cycle. Let q  be thecharge on the capacitor at any time t.

(b) Graph of  v and i versus ωt.The dimension of capacitive reactance is thesame as that of resistance and its SI unit isohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits theamplitude of the current in a purely capacitivecircuit in the same way as the resistance limitsthe current in a purely resistive circuit. But itis inversely proportional to the frequency andthe capacitance.A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with theequation of source voltage, Eq . (7.1) shows thatthe current is π/2 ahead of voltage.Figure 7. 8(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t1. Here the currentphasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotatecounterclockwise. Figure 7. 8(b) shows the variation of voltage and currentwith time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier thanthe voltage by one-fourth of a period.The instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor ispc = i v = im cos(ωt)vm sin(ωt)    = imvm cos(ωt) sin(ωt)    sin(2 )2m mi vtω = (7.19)So, as in the case of an inductor, the average powersin(2 ) sin(2 ) 02 2m m m mCi v i vP t t ω ω = = =since <sin (2 ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle.Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltageby π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predictyour observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in eachcase if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitorgets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit andthe lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ ωC)and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightlythan before.Example 7.4 A 15.0 µ F capacitor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz source.Find the capacitive reactance and the current (rms and peak) in thecircuit.

The glow of the light bulb (a) incr eases; (b)decreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give youranswer with reasons.Solution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coilmagnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductivereactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of theapplied ac voltage appears acr oss the inductor , leaving less voltageacross the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.7.6  AC V OLTAGE APPLIED  TO A SERIES  LCR C IRCUITFigure 7.10 shows a series LCR circuit connected to an ac source e. Asusual, we take the voltage of the source to be v = vm sin wt.If q is the charge on the capacitor and i thecurrent, at time t, we have, from Kirchhoff’s looprule:ddi qL i R vt C+ + = (7.20)We want to deter mine the instantaneouscurrent  i and its phase relationship to the appliedalternating voltage v. We shall solve this pr oblemby two methods. First, we use the technique ofphasors and in the second method, we solveEq. (7.20) analytically to obtain the time–dependence of i.FIGURE  7.10 A series LCR circuitconnected to an ac source.2024-25187Alternating Current7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solutionFrom the cir cuit shown in Fig. 7.10, we see that the r esistor , inductorand capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element isthe same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it bei = im sin(wt+f) (7.21)where f is the phase difference between the voltage across the source andthe current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previoussections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given byEq. (7.21). Further , let VL, VR, VC, and V represent the voltage acr oss theinductor , resistor , capacitor and the sour ce, respectively. Fr om pr evioussection, we know that VR is parallel to I, VC is p/2behind I and VL is  p/2 ahead of I. VL, VR, VC and Iare shown in Fig. 7.11(a) with apppropriate phase-relations.The length of these phasors or the amplitudeof VR, VC and VL are:vRm = im R, vCm = im XC, vLm = im XL(7.22)The voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit canbe written asvL + vR + vC = v (7.23)The phasor relation whose vertical componentgives the above equation isVL + VR + VC = V (7.24)This relation is represented in Fig. 7.11(b). SinceVC  and VL are always along the same line and inopposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor ( VC + VL)which has a magnitude ½vCm – vLm½. Since V is represented as thehypotenuse of a right-triangle whose sides are VR and ( VC + VL), thepythagorean theorem gives:( )2 2 2m Rm Cm Lmv v v v= + −Substituting the values of vRm, vCm, and vLm from Eq.

(7.22), we havetanC LX XRφ−= (7.27)Equations (7.26) and (7.27) are graphically shown in Fig. (7.12).This is called Impedance diagram which is a right-triangle withZ as its hypotenuse.Equation 7.25(a) gives the amplitude of the current and Eq. (7.27)gives the phase angle. With these, Eq. (7.21) is completely specified.If XC > XL, f is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. IfXC < XL, f is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.Consequently, the current in the circuit lags  the source voltage.Figure 7.1 3 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with w tfor the case XC > XL.Thus, we have obtained the amplitudeand phase of current for an LCR series circuitusing the technique of phasors. But thismethod of analysing ac circuits suffers fromcertain disadvantages. First, the phasordiagram say nothing about the initialcondition. One can take any arbitrary valueof t (say, t1, as done throughout this chapter)and draw different phasors which show therelative angle between different phasors.The solution so obtained is called thesteady-state solution . This is not a generalsolution. Additionally, we do have atransient solution  which exists even forv = 0. The general solution is the sum of thetransient solution and the steady-statesolution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solutiondie out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-statesolution.7.6.2  ResonanceAn interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenonof resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systemsthat have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequencyis called the system’s natural frequency . If such a system is driven by anenergy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, theamplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of thisphenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequencyfor swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on theFIGURE  7.12  Impedancediagram.FIGURE  7.13 (a) Phasor diagram of V and I.(b) Graphs of v and i versus w t for a series LCRcircuit where XC > XL.2024-25"
83 Electr omagnetic W aves,"189Alternating Currentrope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost thesame as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will belarge (Chapter 13, Class XI).For an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude vm and frequencyw, we found that the current amplitude is given by2 2( )m mmC Lv viZ R X X= =+ −with Xc = 1/ wC and XL = w L. So if w is varied, then at a particular frequencyw0, Xc = XL, and the impedance is minimum ( )2 20 Z R R= + = . Thisfrequency is called the resonant frequency :001orc LX X LCωω= =or   01LCω= (7.28)At resonant frequency, the current amplitudeis maximum; im = vm/R.Figure 7.16 shows the variation of im with win a RLC series circuit with L = 1.00 mH, C =1.00 nF for two values of R: (i) R = 100 Wand (ii)  R = 200 W. For the sour ce applied vm =100 V . w0 for this case is 1LC       = 1.00×106rad/s.We see that the curr ent amplitude ismaximum at the resonant frequency. Since im =vm / R at resonance, the current amplitude forcase (i) is twice to that for case (ii).Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in thetuning  mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio acceptssignals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in theantenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuitcan be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radiostation, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of acapacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of thecircuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency ofthe signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by acircuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do thevoltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)and the current amplitude is vm/R, the total source voltage appearingacross R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL orRC circuit.FIGURE  7.14  Variation of  im with w for twocases: (i) R = 100 W, (ii) R = 200 W,L = 1.00 mH .2024-25Physics190Example 7.6  A resistor of 200 W and a capacitor of 15.0 mF areconnected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source.

How to r esolve thisparadox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are notin the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added  like ordinarynumbers . The two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees.Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using thePythagorean theorem:2 2R C R CV V V+= += 220 VThus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly takeninto account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitoris equal to the voltage of the source.

Therefore,cos2m mv iP φ = cos2 2m mv iφ =cosV Iφ = [7.30(a)]This can also be written as,2cos P I Z φ = [7.30(b)]So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage andcurrent but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them.

There  is maximum power dissipation.Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit : If the circuit containsonly an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference betweenvoltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipatedeven though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimesreferred to as wattless current .Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) LCR series circuit : In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated isgiven by Eq. (7.30) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – XL )/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  ina RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only inthe resistor.Case (iv) Case (iv)Case (iv) Case (iv)Case (iv)  Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit : At resonanceXc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cos φ = 1 and P = I2Z = I2 R. That is,maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.Example 7.7 Example 7.7 Example 7.7 Example 7.7 Example 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, alow power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor ofappropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.Solution SolutionSolution SolutionSolution  (a) We know that P = I V cos φ where cos φ is the power factor.To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cos φ is small, we have toincrease current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss(I2R) in transmission.(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Thenpower factor cos φ =R/Z.We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend toR.

84 Electromagnetic Spectrum,"Physics192how this can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. Ipalong the applied voltage V and Iq perpendicular to the appliedvoltage. Iq as you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattlesscomponent since corresponding to this component of current, thereis no power loss.  IP  is known as the power component because it isin phase with the voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.It’s clear fr om this analysis that if we want to impr ove power factor ,we must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current Iq by anequal leading wattless current I¢q. This can be done by connectinga capacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that Iq and I¢q canceleach other and P is ef fectively Ip V.Example 7.8  A sinusoidal voltage of peak value 283 V and frequency50 Hz is applied to a series LCR circuit in whichR = 3 W, L = 25.48 mH, and C = 796 mF.

EXAMPLE  7.8  EXAMPLE  7.10Example 7.10 At an airport, a person is made to walk through thedoorway of a metal detector , for security r easons. If she/he is carryinganything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On whatprinciple does this detector work?Solution   The metal detector works on the principle of resonance inac cir cuits. When you walk thr ough a metal detector , you ar e,in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected toa capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. Whenyou walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of thecircuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in thecircuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitrycauses a sound to be emitted as an alarm.2024-25Physics1947.8  T RANSFORMERSFor many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternatingvoltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done witha device called transfor mer using the principle of mutual induction.A transfor mer consists of two sets of coils, insulated fr om each other .They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as inFig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of thecoils called the primary coil  has Np turns. The other coil is called thesecondary coil ; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coiland the secondary coil is the output coil of the transfor mer.FIGURE  7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:(a) two coils on top of each other , (b) two coils on separate limbs of the cor e.When an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resultingcurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondaryand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number ofturns in the secondary. W e consider an ideal transfor mer in which theprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links bothprimary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the coreat time t due to current in the primary when a voltage vp is applied to it.Then the induced emf or voltage es, in the secondary with  Ns turns isdds s Ntφε= − (7.31)The alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in theprimary. This isddp p Ntφε= − (7.32)But ep = vp. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinitesince the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary isan open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a goodapproximationes = vs2024-25195Alternating Currentwhere  vs is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and(7.32) can be written ass sdv Nd tφ= − [7.31(a)]p pdv Nd tφ= − [7.32(a)]From Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we haves sp pv Nv N=(7.33)Note that the above relation has been obtained using threeassumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) thesame flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little fluxescapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,ipvp = isvs(7.34)Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we havep s ss p pi v Ni v N= =(7.35)Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,Eq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values ofcorresponding quantities.Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.We have:VNNVsspp =   and  INNIspsp = (7.36)That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than theprimary ( Ns > Np), the voltage is stepped up  (Vs > Vp). This type ofarrangement is called a step-up transfor mer. However , in this arrangement,there is less current in the secondary than in the primary ( Np/Ns < 1 and Is< Ip). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns andthe secondary has 200 turns,  Ns/Np = 2 and Np/Ns=1/2. Thus, a 220Vinput at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary ( Ns < Np),we have a step-down transfor mer. In this case, Vs < Vp and Is > Ip. Thatis, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the currentis increased.The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (withoutany energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses dooccur due to the following reasons:(i)Flux Leakage : There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all ofthe flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor2024-25Physics196SUMMARY1.An alternating voltage sin= ωm v v t  applied to a resistor R drives acurrent i = im sinwt in the r esistor , mmviR= . The curr ent is in phase withthe applied voltage.2.For an alternating current i  = im sin wt passing through a resistor R , theaverage power loss P  (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is(1/2)i2mR. To express it in the same form as the dc power ( P = I2R), aspecial value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)current and is donoted by I:0.7072mmiI i = =Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by0.7072mmvV v = =We have P = IV = I2R3.An ac voltage v  = vm sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a currentin the inductor i = im sin ( wt – p/2), where im = vm/XL. XL = wL is calledinductive reactance . The current in the inductor lags the voltage byp/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycleis zero.design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced bywinding the primary and secondary coils one over the other .(ii)Resistance of the windings : The wire used for the windings has someresistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised byusing thick wire.(iii)Eddy currents : The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currentsin the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using alaminated core.(iv)Hysteresis : The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed bythe alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy inthe core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magneticmaterial which has a low hysteresis loss.The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy overlong distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage outputof the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced andconsequently, the I2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over longdistances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltageis stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stationsand utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.2024-25197Alternating Current4.An ac voltage v = vm sinwt applied to a capacitor drives a current in thecapacitor:  i = im sin (wt + p/2). Here,1,mm CCvi XX C ω= =  is called capacitive reactance .The current through the capacitor is p /2 ahead of the applied voltage.As in the case of inductor , the average power supplied to a capacitorover one complete cycle is zero.5.For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = vm sin  wt, the current isgiven by i = im sin (wt + f)where( )2 2mmC LviR X X=+ −and1tanC LX XRφ−−=( )2 2C L Z R X X= + −  is called the impedance of the circuit.The average power loss over a complete cycle is given byP = V I cosfThe ter m cosf is called the power factor .6.In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cos f = 0 and no power isdissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,current is referred to as a wattless current .7.The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuitcan be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current byrotating vectors called phasors . A phasor is a vector which rotatesabout the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasorrepresents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage orcurrent) r epresented by the phasor .The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasordiagram.8.A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primarycoil of Np turns and a secondary coil of Ns turns. If the primary coil isconnected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages arerelated byVNNVsspp =and the currents are related byINNIspsp =If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, thevoltage is stepped-up (Vs > Vp). This type of arrangement is called a step-up transfor mer. If the secondary coil has tur ns less than the primary, wehave a step-down transfor mer.2024-25Physics198 Physical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarksrms voltage V [M L2 T–3 A–1] V V = 2mv, vm is theamplitude of the ac voltage.rms current I [ A] A I = 2mi, im is the amplitude ofthe ac current.Reactance:     Inductive XL[M L2 T–3 A–2] XL = L     Capacitive XC[M L2 T–3 A–2] XC = 1/ CImpedance Z [M L2 T–3 A–2] Depends on elementspresent in the circuit.Resonant wr or w0[T–1] Hz w0 LC1  for afrequencyseries RLC circuitQuality factor Q Dimensionless001 LQR C Rωω= =  for a seriesRLC circuit.Power factor Dimensionless = cos f, f is the phasedifference between voltageapplied and current inthe circuit.POINTS TO PONDER1.When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rmsvalue. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room isnormally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitudeof this voltage isV 2 2(240) 340mv V= = =2.The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its averagepower rating.3.The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.4.Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot bederived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying accurrents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction2024-25"
ANSWERS,"199Alternating Currentwith the source frequency and the attractive force would average tozero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some propertythat is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heatingis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value ofalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the sameaverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produceunder the same conditions.5.In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, oneshould take care of their phases properly. For example, if VR and VCare voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then thetotal voltage across RC combination is 2 2RC R CV V V= +  and notVR + VC since VC is p/2 out of phase of VR.6.Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented byvectors, the se quantities are not really vectors themselves. They arescalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases ofharmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the sameway as do the projections of rotating vectors of correspondingmagnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that representharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provideus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule thatwe already know as the law of vector addition.7.There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pureinductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energyin an ac  circuit is the resistive element.8.In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when XL = XC or01LCω= . For r esonance to occur , the pr esence of both L and Celements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these ( L or C)elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence ,no resonance is possible.9.The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close thecircuit is to expending the maximum power .10.In generators and motors, the roles of input and output arereversed. In a motor , electric ener gy is the input and mechanicalenergy is the output. In a generator , mechanical ener gy is theinput and electric energy  is the output. Both devices simplytransfor m ener gy fr om one for m to another .11.A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. Thecurrent is reduced by the same proportion.2024-25Physics200EXERCISES7.1 A 100 W resistor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac supply.(a)What is the rms value of current in the circuit?(b)What is the net power consumed over a full cycle?7.2 (a)The peak voltage of an ac supply is 300 V .

Is the converse also true? Does anelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James ClerkMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not onlyan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magneticfield. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at apoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwellnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested theexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacementcurrent to remove this inconsistency.Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magneticfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. Theseequations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentzforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic lawsof electromagnetism.The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equationsis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speedof the waves,  according to these equations, turned out to be very close to2024-25Physics202the s peed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from opticalmeasurements. This led to the remarkable conclusionthat light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s workthus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism andlight. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated theexistence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological useby Marconi and others led in due course to therevolution in communication that we are witnessingtoday.In this chapter , we first discuss the need fordisplacement current and its consequences. Then wepresent a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,stretching from g rays (wavelength ~10–12 m) to longradio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described.8.2  D ISPLACEMENT  CURRENTWe have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical curr entproduces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showedthat for logical consistency, a changing electric field mustalso produce a magnetic field. This effect is of greatimportance because it explains the existence of radiowaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all otherforms of electromagnetic waves.To see how a changing electric field gives rise toa magnetic field, let us consider the process ofcharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuitallaw given by (Chapter 4)“B.dl = m0 i (t)           (8.1)to find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor .Figure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C whichis a part of circuit through which a time-dependentcurrent i (t) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at apoint such as P , in a r egion outside the parallel platecapacitor .  For this, we consider a plane cir cular loop ofradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the directionof the current-carrying wire, and which is centredsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. Fromsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along thecircumference of the circular loop and is the same inmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is themagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2p r).So we haveB (2pr) = m0i (t)    (8 .2)JAMES CLERK MAXWELL (1831–1879)James Clerk Maxwell(1831 – 1879)  Born inEdinburgh, Scotland,was among the greatestphysicists of thenineteenth century. Hederived the thermalvelocity distribution ofmolecules in a gas andwas among the first toobtain reliableestimates of molecularparameters frommeasurable quantitieslike viscosity, etc.Maxwell’s greatestacheivement was theunification of the laws ofelectricity andmagnetism (discoveredby Coulomb, Oersted,Ampere and Faraday)into a consistent set ofequations now calledMaxwell’s equations.From these he arrived atthe most importantconclusion that light isan electromagneticwave. Interestingly,Maxwell did not agreewith the idea (stronglysuggested by theFaraday’s laws ofelectrolysis) thatelectricity wasparticulate in nature.2024-25203ElectromagneticWavesNow, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. Thisis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, buthas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circularloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to suchsurfaces with the same perimeter , we find that the left hand side ofEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not m0i,since no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So wehave a contradiction ; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at apoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,this law must be missing something. The missing term must be suchthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P ,  no matter what sur faceis used.We can actually guess the missing ter m by looking car efully atFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between theplates of the capacitor? Y es, of course, the electric field! If the plates of thecapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of theelectric field E between the plates is ( Q/A)/e0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field isperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitudeover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So whatis the electric flux FE through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it isE0 01= =Q QA AAΦε ε= E (8.3)Now if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is acurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we haveddddddΦEt tQ Qt==ε ε0 01This implies that for consistency,ε0ddΦEt = i (8.4)This is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law. If we generalisethis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors throughthe surface, another term which is e0 times the rate of change of electricflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current ifor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of Bobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point Pis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at apoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M justinside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow ofcharges is called conduction current . The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is anew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,an old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacementcurrent  or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electricand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The sourceof a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to  flowingFIGURE  8.1 Aparallel platecapacitor C, as part ofa circuit throughwhich a timedependent currenti (t) flows,  (a) a loop ofradius r, to deter minemagnetic field at apoint P on the loop;(b) a pot-shapedsurface passingthrough the interiorbetween the capacitorplates with the loopshown in (a) as itsrim; (c) a tiffin-shaped surface withthe circular loop asits rim and a flatcircular bottom Sbetween the capacitorplates. The arrowsshow uniform electricfield between thecapacitor plates.2024-25Physics204charges, but also the time rate of change of electric field. Moreprecisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction currentdenoted by ic, and the displacement current denoted by id (= e0 (dFE/dt)). So we have0ddEc d ci i i itΦε = + = + (8.5)In explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates,we have only conduction current ic = i, and no displacementcurrent, i.e., id = 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor , ther e isno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacementcurrent, so that id = i.The generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the sameform as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current  passingthrough any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” isthe sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.The generalised law isB lg□d =dd0 µ µ ε0 0itcE+ ∫Φ(8.6)and is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.In all respects, the displacement current has the same physicaleffects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steadyelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current maybe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In othercases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conductionand displacement currents may be present in different regions ofspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the sameregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectlyinsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regionsof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only adisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such aregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)current source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement currentcan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at pointM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured andis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).The displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity andmagnetism are now more symmetrical *. Faraday’s law of induction statesthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unitcharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existenceof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagneticinduction by saying that a magnetic field,  changing with time, gives riseto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field  changing withtime gives rise to a magnetic field,  is the symmetrical counterpart, and isFIGURE  8.2 (a) Theelectric and magneticfields E and B betweenthe capacitor plates, atthe point M. (b) A crosssectional view of Fig. (a).*They are still not perfectly symmetrical; there are no known sources of magneticfield (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources ofelectric field.2024-25205ElectromagneticWavesa consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magneticfield. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to eachother! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwelllaw give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the currentbeing the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequenceof this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which wediscuss qualitatively in the next section.MAXWELL ’S EQUATIONS  IN VACUUM1. “E.dA = Q/✒0(Gauss’s Law for electricity)2. “B.dA = 0 (Gauss’s Law for magnetism)3. “E.dl =–ddBΦtl= (Faraday’s Law)4. “B.dl ==dd0 µ µ ε0 0itcE+Φ(Ampere – Maxwell Law)8.3  E LECTROMAGNETIC W AVES8.3.1  Sources of electromagnetic wavesHow are electromagnetic waves produced?

The former produces only electrostatic fields, whilethe latter pr oduces magnetic fields that, however , do not vary with time.It is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated chargesradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyondthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   Thisproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces anoscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electricfield, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thusregenerate each other , so to speak, as the wave pr opagates thr ough thespace. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals thefrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with thepropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – theaccelerated charge.From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test theprediction that light is an electr omagnetic wave. W e might think that allwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillateat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is notpossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while thefrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic2024-25Physics206wave had to come in the low frequency region (the radiowave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887).Hertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’stheory created a sensation and sparked off otherimportant works in this field. Two importantachievements in this connection deserve mention. Sevenyears after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working atCalcutta (now Kolkata),  succeeded in producing andobserving electromagnetic waves of much shorterwavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like thatof Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italyfollowed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmittingelectromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.Marconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the field ofcommunication using electromagnetic waves.8.3.2  Nature of electromagnetic wavesIt can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electricand magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave areperpendicular to each other , and to the dir ection ofpropagation. It appears reasonable, say from ourdiscussion of the displacement current. ConsiderFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitoris directed perpendicular to the plates. The magneticfield this gives rise to via the displacement current isalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitorplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. Thisis a general feature.In Fig. 8.3, we show a typical example of a planeelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, ata given time t). The electric field Ex is along the x-axis,and varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. Themagnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again variessinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields Exand By are perpendicular to eachother , and to the dir ection z ofpropagation. W e can write Ex andBy as follows:Ex= E0 sin ( kz–wt)[8.7(a)]By= B0 sin ( kz–wt)[8.7(b)]Here k is related to the wave lengthl of the wave by the usualequation2kλπ= (8.8) EXAMPLE  8.1Heinrich Rudolf Hertz(1857 – 1894)  Germanphysicist who was thefirst to broadcast andreceive radio waves. Heproduced electro-magnetic waves, sentthem through space, andmeasured their wave-length and speed. Heshowed that the natureof their vibration,reflection and refractionwas the same as that oflight and heat waves,establishing theiridentity for the first time.He also pioneeredresearch on discharge ofelectricity through gases,and discovered thephotoelectric effect.HEINRICH RUDOLF HER TZ (1857–1894)FIGURE  8.3 A linearly polarised electromagnetic wave,propagating in the z-direction with the oscillating electric field Ealong the x-direction and the oscillating magnetic field B alongthe y-direction.2024-25207ElectromagneticWavesand ω   is the angular frequency. k is the magnitude of the wave vector (orpropagation vector) k and its direction describes the direction ofpropagation of the wave. The speed of propagation of the wave is ( ω/k).Using Eqs. [8.7(a) and (b)] for Ex and By  and Maxwell’s equations, onefinds thatω = ck, where, c = 1/0 0µ ε [8.9(a)]The relation ω = ck is the standard one for waves (see for example,Section 14.4 of class XI Physics textbook). This relation is often writtenin terms of frequency, ν (=ω/2π) and wavelength, λ (=2π/k) as22πνλ= cπ   orνλ = c [8.9(b)]It is also seen from Maxwell’s equations that the magnitude of theelectric and the magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are related asB0 = (E0/c) (8.10)We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves.They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields infree space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we havestudied so far, in respect that no material medium  is involved in thevibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. Wehave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside amedium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magneticpermeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differfrom the external fields). These replace ε0 and µ0 in the description toelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that ina material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, thevelocity of light becomes,1vµε=(8.11)Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties ofthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index  ofone medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities oflight in the two media.The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is animportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments onelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is thesame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, outof a value of 3 ×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves invacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value isso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length .The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stemsfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another. Theradio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Lightcarries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible onthe earth.2024-25Physics208 EXAMPLE  8.2  EXAMPLE  8.1Example 8.1 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency25 MHz travels in free space along the x-direction.

Therefore, B should be in a directionperpendicular to both x- and y-axes. Using vector algebra, E × B shouldbe along  x-direction. Since, (+ˆj) × (+ˆk) = ˆi, B is along the z-direction.Thus, B = 2.1  × 10–8 ˆkTExample 8.2  The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave isgiven by By = (2 × 10–7) T sin ( 0.5×103x+1.5 ×1011t).(a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?(b) Write an expression for the electric field.Solution(a) Comparing the given equation with2pλx tT+By=B0 SinWe get, 320.5 10πλ=× m = 1.26 cm,and   ( )11 11.5 10 /2 23.9 GHzTν= = × π =(b)E0 = B0c = 2×10–7 T × 3 × 108 m/s = 6 × 101 V/mThe electric field component is perpendicular to the direction ofpropagation and the direction of magnetic field.

The existenceof ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of thenineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered.  Wenow know that, e lectrom agnetic  waves include visible light waves, X-rays,gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. Theclassification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagneticspectrum (Fig. 8. 4). There is no sharp division between one kind of waveand the next . The classification is based roughly on how the waves areproduced and/or detected.We briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, inorder of decreasing wavelengths.Electromagnetic spectrumhttp://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/more/lighthttp://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/2024-25209ElectromagneticWavesFIGURE  8.4 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for variouspart of it. The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries.8.4.1  Radio wavesRadio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conductingwires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. Theyare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.The AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higherfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave  bands. TV waves rangefrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio bandextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves totransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. Howthese waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.8.4.2  MicrowavesMicrowaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in thegigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (calledklystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radaralso provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-serves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domesticapplication of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwavesis selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so thatenergy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy ofthe molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.2024-25Physics2108.4.3 Infrared wavesInfrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This bandlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visiblespectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves . Thisis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorbinfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorbinfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used inphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role inmaintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through thegreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easilythrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation istrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour .Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposesand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for examplesemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widelyused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TVsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.8.4.4 Visible raysIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of thespectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014 Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us providesus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range ofwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range ofwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.8.4.5 Ultraviolet raysIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet ( UV) radiation is produced by speciallamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultravioletlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in theatmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantitieshas harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces theproduction of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation isabsorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburnthrough glass windows.Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windowsto protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.Due to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into verynarrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK ( Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to killgerms  in water purifiers.Ozone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence itsdepletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matterof international concern.2024-25211ElectromagneticWaves8.4.6 X-raysBeyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-rayregion. W e are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. Itcovers wavelengths from about 10–8 m (10 nm) down to 10–13 m(10–4 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metaltarget by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool inmedicine and as a tr eatment for certain for ms of cancer . Because X-raysdamage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken toavoid unnecessary or over exposure.8.4.7 Gamma raysThey lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrumand have wavelengths of from about 10–10m to less than 10–14m. Thishigh frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions andalso emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroycancer cells.Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, theirproduction and detections. As mentioned earlier , the demarcation betweendifferent regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.TABLE 8.1 D IFFERENT  TYPES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  WAVESType Wavelength range Production DetectionRadio > 0.1 m Rapid  acceleration and Receiver’s aerialsdecelerations of electronsin aerialsMicrowave 0.1m to 1 mm Klystron valve or Point contact diodesmagnetron valveInfra-red 1mm to 700 nm Vibration of atoms Thermopilesand molecules Bolometer , Infrar edphotographic filmLight 700 nm to 400 nm Electrons in atoms emit The eyelight when they move from Photocellsone energy level to a Photographic filmlower energy levelUltraviolet 400 nm to 1nm Inner shell electrons in Photocellsatoms moving from one Photographic filmenergy level  to a lower levelX-rays 1nm to 10–3 nm X-ray tubes or inner shell Photographic filmelectrons Geiger tubesIonisation chamberGamma rays  <10–3 nm Radioactive decay of the -do-nucleus2024-25Physics212SUMMARY1.Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested theexistence of an additional current, called displacement current, to removethis inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electricfield and is given by0ddditΦεΕ=and acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conductioncurrent.2.An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric chargeoscillating harmonically with frequency n, produces electromagnetic wavesof the same frequency n. An electric dipole is a basic source ofelectromagnetic waves.3.Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres werefirst produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thusverified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.4.Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in anelectromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E andB are perpendicular to each other , and to the dir ection of pr opagation ofthe electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency n, wavelength l,propagating along z-direction, we haveE  = Ex (t) = E0 sin ( kz – w t )   = E0 sin    2 20 π πzt Ez tT λνλ−= −sinB = By(t) = B0 sin ( kz – w t)   = Bzt Bz tT0 0 2 2sin sin π πλνλ−= −They are related by  E0/B0 = c.5.The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to m0 and e0 (thefree space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:0 0 1/cµ ε= . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained fromoptical measurements.Light is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.Electromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c infree space.The speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium isgiven by 1/v µε=where m is the permeability of the medium and e its permittivity.6.The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over aninfinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by differentnames; g-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays,microwaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength  from 10–2 Åor 10–12 m to 106 m.They interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which setin oscillation char ges pr esent in all matter . The detailed interaction andso the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelengthof the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and moleculesin the medium.2024-25213ElectromagneticWavesPOINTS TO PONDER1.The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waveslies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel throughvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter .2.Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. Thewavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with thecharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,having wavelength of 10–14 m to 10–15 m, typically originate from anatomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio wavesare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmittingantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength ofabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atomsis, however , much longer in wavelength than atomic size.3.Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of asubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy andconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infraredwaves are often called heat waves .4.The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of thewavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolvedwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths fromthe sun.EXERCISES8.1 Figure 8.5 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each ofradius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm.

Energy of a photon that a source produces indicates the spacingsof the relevant energy levels of the source. For example, λ = 10–12 mcorresponds to photon energy = 1.24 × 106 eV = 1.24 MeV. Thisindicates that nuclear energy levels (transition between which causes2024-25Physics220γ-ray emission) are typically spaced by 1 MeV or so. Similarly, avisible wavelength λ = 5 × 10–7 m, corresponds to photon energy= 2.5 eV. This implies that energy levels (transition between whichgives visible radiation) are typically spaced by a few eV.8.10 (a) λ = (c/ν) = 1.5 ×  10–2 m(b)B0 = (E0/c) = 1.6 × 10–7 T(c)Energy density in E field: uE = (1/2) ε0 E2Energy density in B field: uB = (1/2 µ0)B2Using E = cB, and c = 0 01µ ε, uE = uB2024-25"
