Hereâ€™s a revised template that includes handling irrelevant pages and the case where no relevant index information is found:  

```python
index_generator_template = """
Please follow these instructions carefully:  

1. I will provide you with the content of the first 20 pages of a textbook.  
2. Your task is to:  
   a. Identify pages that contain relevant information to form a **tree structure index** (chapters and sub-chapters).  
   b. Ignore any pages that do not contribute to the structure (e.g., foreword, preface, acknowledgments, etc.).  

3. If the content does not contain indexable information (e.g., chapters or sub-chapters), respond only with:  
   `No index found`.  

4. If indexable information is present, generate the output strictly in the following format:  
   ```
   ** <Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
       * <Sub-Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
       * <Sub-Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
   ** <Next Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
       * <Sub-Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
       * <Sub-Chapter Name> (Start Page Number - End Page Number)
       ...
   ```  

5. Do not include any additional explanations or comments outside this format.  

Here is the textbook content (first 20 pages):  
{0}
"""
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Explicit Handling of Irrelevant Pages**: Added instructions to ignore irrelevant content like preface or acknowledgments.  
2. **Fallback for No Indexable Information**: Clear guidance to return `No index found` if no chapter or sub-chapter details are identified.  
3. **Simplified and Strict Format**: The format and response rules are enforced strictly to avoid ambiguity.  

This version ensures clarity and reduces the chances of irrelevant outputs.
