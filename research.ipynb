      "This vision of computing utilities based on a service-provisioning model anticipated the massive\n",

      "1One of\n",
      "the most diffuse views of cloud computing can be summarized as follows:\n",

      " No up-front commitments\n",
      " On-demand access\n",
      " Nice pricing\n",
      " Simplified application acceleration and scalability Efficient resource allocation Energy efficiency Seamless creation and use of third-party services\n",
      "The most evident benefit from the use of cloud computing systems and technologies is the\n",
      "increased economical return due to the reduced maintenance costs and operational costs related to\n",
      "IT software and infrastructure. This is mainly because IT assets, namely software and infrastructure,are turned into utility costs , which are paid for as long as they are used, not paid for up front.\n",
      "Capital costs are costs associated with assets that need to be paid in advance to start a businessactivity. Before cloud computing, IT infrastructure and software generated capital costs, since they\n",
      "were paid up front so that business start-ups could afford a computing infrastructure, enabling the\n",
      "business activities of the organization. The revenue of the business is then utilized to compensateover time for these costs. Organizations always minimize capital costs, since they are often associ-ated with depreciable values. This is the case of hardware: a server bought today for $1,000 willhave a market value less than its original price when it is eventually replaced by new hardware. Tomake profit, organizations have to compensate for this depreciation created by time, thus reducingthe net gain obtained from revenue. Minimizing capital costs, then, is fundamental. Cloud comput-ing transforms IT infrastructure and software into utilities, thus significantly contributing to increas-\n",

      "organizations and start-ups: these do not need large investments to start their business, but they cancomfortably grow with it. Finally, maintenance costs are significantly reduced: by renting the13 1.1 Cloud computing at a glanceinfrastructure and the application services, organizations are no longer responsible for their mainte-\n",
      "nance. This task is the responsibility of the cloud service provider, who, thanks to economies of\n",
      "scale, can bear the maintenance costs.\n",
      "Increased agility in defining and structuring software systems is another significant benefit of\n",
      "cloud computing. Since organizations rent IT services, they can more dynamically and flexibly com-pose their software systems, without being constrained by capital costs for IT assets. There is areduced need for capacity planning, since cloud computing allows organizations to react tounplanned surges in demand quite rapidly. For example, organizations can add more servers to pro-cess workload spikes and dismiss them when they are no longer needed. Ease of scalability is anotheradvantage. By leveraging the potentially huge capacity of cloud computing, organizations can extend\n",
      "their IT capability more easily. Scalability can be leveraged across the entire computing stack.\n",
      "Infrastructure providers offer simple methods to provision customized hardware and integrate it intoexisting systems. Platform-as-a-Service providers offer runtime environment and programming mod-els that are designed to scale applications. Software-as-a-Service offerings can be elastically sized ondemand without requiring users to provision hardware or to program application for scalability.\n",
      "End users can benefit from cloud computing by having their data and the capability of operating\n",

      "office automation features, photo editing, information management, and so on) also reside in thecloud, end users can perform the same tasks that previously were carried out through considerablesoftware investments. The cost for such opportunities is generally very limited, since the cloud ser-vice provider shares its costs across all the tenants that he is servicing. Multitenancy allows for bet-ter utilization of the shared infrastructure that is kept operational and fully active. Theconcentration of IT infrastructure and services into large datacenters also provides opportunity forconsiderable optimization in terms of resource allocation and energy efficiency, which eventually\n",
      "can lead to a less impacting approach on the environment.\n",

Since it ispossible to provision on demand any component of the computing stack, it is easier to turn ideas intoproducts with limited costs and by concentrating technical efforts on what matters: the added value.\n",

In14 CHAPTER 1 Introductionaddition, issues and challenges concerning the integration of real and virtual infrastructure need to\n",
      "be taken into account from different perspectives, such as security and legislation.\n",
      "Security in terms of confidentiality, secrecy, and protection of data in a cloud environment is\n",
      "another important challenge. Organizations do not own the infrastructure they use to process dataand store information. This condition poses challenges for confidential data, which organizationscannot afford to reveal. Therefore, assurance on the confidentiality of data and compliance to secu-rity standards, which give a minimum guarantee on the treatment of information on cloud comput-ing systems, are sought. The problem is not as evident as it seems: even though cryptography canhelp secure the transit of data from the private premises to the cloud infrastructure, in order to beprocessed the information needs to be decrypted in memory. This is the weak point of the chain:\n",
      "since virtualization allows capturing almost transparently the memory pages of an instance, these\n",

      "Legal issues may also arise. These are specifically tied to the ubiquitous nature of cloud com-\n",
      "puting, which spreads computing infrastructure across diverse geographical locations. Different leg-islation about privacy in different countries may potentially create disputes as to the rights thatthird parties (including government agencies) have to your data.

      "1.2 Historical developments\n",
      "The idea of renting computing services by leveraging large distributed computing facilities has\n",
      "been around for long time. It dates back to the days of the mainframes in the early 1950s. Fromthere on, technology has evolved and been refined. This process has created a series of favorableconditions for the realization of cloud computing.\n",
      "Figure 1.6 provides an overview of the evolution of the distributed computing technologies that\n",
      "have influenced cloud computing. In tracking the historical evolution, we briefly review five core\n",
      "technologies that played an important role in the realization of cloud computing. These technolo-gies are distributed systems, virtualization, Web 2.0, service orientation, and utility computing.\n",
      "1.2.1 Distributed systems\n",
      "Clouds are essentially large distributed computing facilities that make available their services to\n",
      "third parties on demand. As a reference, we consider the characterization of a distributed systemproposed by Tanenbaum et al. [1]:\n",
      "A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single\n",
      "coherent system.15 1.2 Historical developmentsThis is a general definition that includes a variety of computer systems, but it evidences two\n",
      "very important elements characterizing a distributed system: the fact that it is composed of multipleindependent components and that these components are perceived as a single entity by users. Thisis particularly true in the case of cloud computing, in which clouds hide the complex architecture\n",
      "they rely on and provide a single interface to users. The primary purpose of distributed systems is\n",
      "to share resources and utilize them better. This is true in the case of cloud computing, where thisconcept is taken to the extreme and resources (infrastructure, runtime environments, and services)are rented to users. In fact, one of the driving factors of cloud computing has been the availabilityof the large computing facilities of IT giants (Amazon, Google) that found that offering their com-puting capabilities as a service provided opportunities to better utilize their infrastructure.Distributed systems often exhibit other properties such as heterogeneity ,openness ,scalability ,\n",

      "though mainframes cannot be considered distributed systems, they offered large computationalpower by using multiple processors, which were presented as a single entity to users. One of themost attractive features of mainframes was the ability to be highly reliable computers that were“always on” and capable of tolerating failures transparently. No system shutdown was requiredto replace failed components, and the system could work without interruption. Batch processingwas the main application of mainframes. Now their popularity and deployments have reduced,but evolved versions of such systems are still in use for transaction processing (such as online\n",

      "4One of the attractive\n",
      "features of clusters was that the computational power of commodity machines could beleveraged to solve problems that were previously manageable only on expensivesupercomputers. Moreover, clusters could be easily extended if more computational powerwas required.\n",
      "Grids . Grid computing [8] appeared in the early 1990s as an evolution of cluster computing. In\n",
      "an analogy to the power grid, grid computing proposed a new approach to access largecomputational power, huge storage facilities, and a variety of services. Users can “consume”resources in the same way as they use other utilities such as power, gas, and water. Gridsinitially developed as aggregations of geographically dispersed clusters by means of Internetconnections. These clusters belonged to different organizations, and arrangements were madeamong them to share the computational power. Different from a “large cluster,” a computinggrid was a dynamic aggregation of heterogeneous computing nodes, and its scale was\n",
      "nationwide or even worldwide. Several developments made possible the diffusion of computing\n",
      "grids: (a) clusters became quite common resources; (b) they were often underutilized; (c) newproblems were requiring computational power that went beyond the capability of singleclusters; and (d) the improvements in networking and the diffusion of the Internet madepossible long-distance, high-bandwidth connectivity. All these elements led to the developmentof grids, which now serve a multitude of users across the world.\n",

      "aspects of all these three major technologies. Computing clouds are deployed in large datacenters\n",
      "hosted by a single organization that provides services to others. Clouds are characterized by the\n",
      "fact of having virtually infinite capacity, being tolerant to failures, and being always on, as in thecase of mainframes. In many cases, the computing nodes that form the infrastructure of computingclouds are commodity machines, as in the case of clusters. The services made available by a cloudvendor are consumed on a pay-per-use basis, and clouds fully implement the utility vision intro-duced by grid computing.\n",
      "1.2.2 Virtualization\n",
      "Virtualization is another core technology for cloud computing. It encompasses a collection of solu-\n",
      "tions allowing the abstraction of some of the fundamental elements for computing, such as hard-ware, runtime environments, storage, and networking. Virtualization has been around for more than40 years, but its application has always been limited by technologies that did not allow an efficientuse of virtualization solutions. Today these limitations have been substantially overcome, and vir-tualization has become a fundamental element of cloud computing. This is particularly true for\n",
      "solutions that provide IT infrastructure on demand. Virtualization confers that degree of customiza-\n",

      "Virtualization is essentially a technology that allows creation of different computing environ-\n",

      "by a guest. The most common example of virtualization is hardware virtualization . This technology\n",
      "allows simulating the hardware interface expected by an operating system. Hardware virtualizationallows the coexistence of different software stacks on top of the same hardware. These stacks are\n",
      "contained inside virtual machine instances , which operate in complete isolation from each other.\n",
      "High-performance servers can host several virtual machine instances, thus creating the opportunityto have a customized software stack on demand. This is the base technology that enables cloudcomputing solutions to deliver virtual servers on demand, such as Amazon EC2, RightScale,VMware vCloud, and others.

      "tioncomplete the range of technologies for the emulation of IT infrastructure.\n",
      "Virtualization technologies are also used to replicate runtime environments for programs.\n",
      "Applications in the case of process virtual machines (which include the foundation of technologies\n",

      "gram called a virtual machine . This technique allows isolating the execution of applications and pro-\n",
      "viding a finer control on the resource they access. Process virtual machines offer a higher level ofabstraction with respect to hardware virtualization, since the guest is only constituted by an applica-tion rather than a complete software stack. This approach is used in cloud computing to provide aplatform for scaling applications on demand, such as Google AppEngine and Windows Azure.\n",
      "Having isolated and customizable environments with minor impact on performance is what\n",
      "makes virtualization a attractive technology. Cloud computing is realized through platforms that\n",

      "The Web is the primary interface through which cloud computing delivers its services. At present,\n",
      "the Web encompasses a set of technologies and services that facilitate interactive information shar-\n",
      "ing, collaboration, user-centered design, and application composition. This evolution has trans-formed the Web into a rich platform for application development and is known as Web 2.0. This\n",
      "term captures a new way in which developers architect applications and deliver services throughthe Internet and provides new experience for users of these applications and services.\n",
      "Web 2.0 brings interactivity andflexibility into Web pages, providing enhanced user experience\n",
      "by gaining Web-based access to all the functions that are normally found in desktop applications.These capabilities are obtained by integrating a collection of standards and technologies such as\n",
      "XML ,Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) ,Web Services , and others. These technologies\n",
      "allow us to build applications leveraging the contribution of users, who now become providers ofcontent. Furthermore, the capillary diffusion of the Internet opens new opportunities and marketsfor the Web, the services of which can now be accessed from a variety of devices: mobile phones,car dashboards, TV sets, and others. These new scenarios require an increased dynamism for appli-cations, which is another key element of this technology. Web 2.0 applications are extremelydynamic: they improve continuously, and new updates and features are integrated at a constant rateby following the usage trend of the community. There is no need to deploy new software releases\n",
      "on the installed base at the client side. Users can take advantage of the new software features sim-\n",
      "ply by interacting with cloud applications. Lightweight deployment and programming models arevery important for effective support of such dynamism. Loose coupling is another fundamentalproperty. New applications can be “synthesized” simply by composing existing services and inte-grating them, thus providing added value. This way it becomes easier to follow the interests ofusers. Finally, Web 2.0 applications aim to leverage the “long tail” of Internet users by makingthemselves available to everyone in terms of either media accessibility or affordability.\n",
      "Examples of Web 2.0 applications are Google Documents ,Google Maps ,Flickr ,Facebook ,\n",
      "Twitter ,YouTube ,de.li.cious ,Blogger , and Wikipedia . In particular, social networking Websites\n",
      "take the biggest advantage of Web 2.0. The level of interaction in Websites such as Facebook orFlickr would not have been possible without the support of AJAX, Really Simple Syndication(RSS), and other tools that make the user experience incredibly interactive. Moreover, communityWebsites harness the collective intelligence of the community, which provides content to the appli-cations themselves: Flickr provides advanced services for storing digital pictures and videos,Facebook is a social networking site that leverages user activity to provide content, and Blogger,like any other blogging site, provides an online diary that is fed by users.\n",
      "This idea of the Web as a transport that enables and enhances interaction was introduced in\n",
      "1999 by Darcy DiNucci\n",

      "contributed to making people more accustomed to the use of the Internet in their everyday lives\n",
      "and opened the path to the acceptance of cloud computing as a paradigm, whereby even theIT infrastructure is offered through a Web interface.\n",
      "1.2.4 Service-oriented computing\n",
      "Service orientation is the core reference model for cloud computing systems. This approach adopts\n",
      "the concept of services as the main building blocks of application and system development.Service-oriented computing (SOC) supports the development of rapid, low-cost, flexible, interopera-\n",
      "ble, and evolvable applications and systems [19].\n",
      "Aservice is an abstraction representing a self-describing and platform-agnostic component that\n",
      "can perform any function—anything from a simple function to a complex business process.\n",
      "Virtually any piece of code that performs a task can be turned into a service and expose its func-tionalities through a network-accessible protocol. A service is supposed to be loosely coupled ,reus-\n",
      "able,programming language independent , and location transparent . Loose coupling allows\n",
      "services to serve different scenarios more easily and makes them reusable. Independence from aspecific platform increases services accessibility.

      "logical way of organizing software systems to provide end users or other entities distributed over\n",

      "language that defines the characteristics of the service and all the methods, together with para-meters, descriptions, and return type, exposed by the service. The interaction with Web serviceshappens through Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [23]. This is an XML language that\n",
      "defines how to invoke a Web service method and collect the result. Using SOAP and WSDL\n",
      "over HTTP, Web services become platform independent and accessible to the World Wide Web.\n",

      "with the advent of cloud computing. Among the earliest forerunners of this vision we can include\n",
      "the American scientist John McCarthy, who, in a speech for the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT) centennial in 1961, observed:\n",
      "If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing\n",
      "may someday be organized as a public utility, just as the telephone system is a public utility ...\n",
      "The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.\n",
      "The first traces of this service-provisioning model can be found in the mainframe era. IBM and\n",

The business model introduced with utility computingbrought new requirements and led to improvements in mainframe technology: additional featuressuch as operating systems, process control, and user-metering facilities. The idea of computing asutility remained and extended from the business domain to academia with the advent of clustercomputing. Not only businesses but also research institutes became acquainted with the idea ofleveraging an external IT infrastructure on demand. Computational science, which was one of themajor driving factors for building computing clusters, still required huge compute power for addres-\n",

      "computing accessible on a wider scale, it is easier to provide a trading infrastructure where gridproducts—storage, computation, and services—are bid for or sold. Moreover, e-commerce technol-ogies [25] provided the infrastructure support for utility computing.

      "while, so it is not feasible to buy the infrastructure supporting them. In this case, cloud computing\n",
      "can be the solution. Resource-intensive applications are not interactive and they are mostly charac-terized by batch processing.\n",
      "Cloud computing provides a solution for on-demand and dynamic scaling across the entire stack\n",
      "of computing. This is achieved by (a) providing methods for renting compute power, storage, andnetworking; (b) offering runtime environments designed for scalability and dynamic sizing; and(c) providing application services that mimic the behavior of desktop applications but that arecompletely hosted and managed on the provider side.
